<title>ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT</title>
<author>    By William Kazer, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    HONG KONG, April 8 - </dateline>Mounting trade friction between the
U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting
nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic
damage, businessmen and officials said.
    They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.
Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the
U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.
    But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt
them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be
their gain.
    The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on
imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in
retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not
to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.
    Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs
at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms
said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the
new taxes.
    ""We wouldn't be able to do business,"" said a spokesman for
leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T&gt;.
    ""If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time
beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of
exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,"" said Tom
Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James
Capel and Co&gt;.
    In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.
    ""We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against
Japan because it serves as a warning to us,"" said a senior
Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.
    Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last
year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.
    The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves
to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.
    ""We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and
cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we
want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,"" said
Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group&gt;.
    A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion
association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan
might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports
are similar to those of Japan.
    Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion
dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.
    In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough
curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of
semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the
U.S.
    In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been
selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics
manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such
a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by
further U.S. Pressure to block imports.
    ""That is a very short-term view,"" said Lawrence Mills,
director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.
    ""If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will
be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong
is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,"" he said.
    The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,
accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.
    The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade
talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,
Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.
    ""This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two
countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very
serious matter,"" Button said.
    He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,
Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant
U.S. Exports to that country.
    Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the
trade stand-off continue.
    Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined
a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.
    The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget
and record public works spending in the first half of the
financial year.
    They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency
measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.
    Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto
Kuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and
Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an
effort to end the dispute.

<title>CHINA DAILY SAYS VERMIN EAT 7-12 PCT GRAIN STOCKS</title>
<dateline>    PEKING, April 8 - </dateline>A survey of 19 provinces and seven cities
showed vermin consume between seven and 12 pct of China's grain
stocks, the China Daily said.
    It also said that each year 1.575 mln tonnes, or 25 pct, of
China's fruit output are left to rot, and 2.1 mln tonnes, or up
to 30 pct, of its vegetables. The paper blamed the waste on
inadequate storage and bad preservation methods.
    It said the government had launched a national programme to
reduce waste, calling for improved technology in storage and
preservation, and greater production of additives. The paper

<title>JAPAN TO REVISE LONG-TERM ENERGY DEMAND DOWNWARDS</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 8 - </dateline>The Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand
outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese
energy demand, ministry officials said.
    MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy
supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600
mln, they said.
    The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in
Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen
and a decline in domestic electric power demand.
    MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand
outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the
Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.
    They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy
supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.
    Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric power
in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27
pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and
liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.

<title>THAI TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FIRST QUARTER</title>
<dateline>    BANGKOK, April 8 - </dateline>Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5
billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a
year ago, the Business Economics Department said.
    It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht
from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this
year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials
and semi-finished products.
    The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the
first quarter due to lower oil prices.
    The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6
billion baht from 56.6 billion.
    Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower
earnings from many key commodities including rice whose
earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26
pct and canned pineapples seven pct.
    Products registering high export growth were jewellery up
64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.

<title>AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN SHIP BAN ENDS BUT NSW PORTS HIT</title>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, April 8 - </dateline>Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW),
Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on
foreign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still
being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.
    The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented
the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.
    The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration
Commission today.
    Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the
ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.
    The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week
of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to
protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.
    The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to
be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of
each shift and then to walk off.
    Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with
container movements most affected, but has not stopped
altogether, they said.
    They said they could not say how long the disruption will
go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.

<title>SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER</title>
<author>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 8 - </dateline>Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T&gt; is certain to
lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of
its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.
    Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9
trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank
with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in
October.
    But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu
told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its
position.
    ""We'll be back in position in first place within three
years,"" Komatsu said in an interview.
    He said that while the merger will initially reduce
Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand
Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where
it has been relatively weak.
    But financial analysts are divided on whether and how
quickly the gamble will pay off.
    Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in
view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger
was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch
network from scratch.
    The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has
expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business
and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the
wisdom of some of those moves.
    ""They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now
it's largely out of their hands,"" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd
financial analyst Simon Smithson.
    Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to
enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American
investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.
    Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5
pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at
least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange
personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.
    ""The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the
Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,"" said one analyst.
    But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.
    ""U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,
we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three
years, not until the 21st century,"" Komatsu said.
    Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes
into the securities business at home.
    Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's
version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial
from investment banking.
    But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu
said he hopes further deregulation will create new
opportunities.
    ""We need to find new business chances,"" Komatsu said. ""In some
cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust
bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.""
    Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such
domestic securities business as profitable government bond
dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co
Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.
    He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering
the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank
subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.
     The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to
securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,
following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European
universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.
    But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar
decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.
    ""We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed
in two or three years,"" he said.
    Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand
lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to
replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.
    The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of
time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the
merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.
    ""It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,"" said
Kleinwort's Smithson.
    ""After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling
around. It will be the next decade before we see if the
strategy is right or wrong.""

<title>BUNDESBANK ALLOCATES 6.1 BILLION MARKS IN TENDER</title>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, April 8 - </dateline>The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1
billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities
repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank
spokesman said.
    Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,
will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy
back securities pledged on May 6.
    Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as
an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively
withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with
today's allocation.
    A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the
withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit
policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful
liquidity in the banking system.
    Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank
over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely
April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.
    The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2
billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks
themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much
liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the
effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main
open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two
further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.
    The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6
and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that
range are possible, dealers said.

<title>BOND CORP STILL CONSIDERING ATLAS MINING BAIL-OUT</title>
<dateline>    MANILA, April 8 - </dateline>Bond Corp Holdings Ltd &lt;BONA.S&gt; and Atlas
Consolidated Mining and Development Corp &lt;ATLC.MN&gt; are still
holding talks on a bail-out package for the troubled mining
firm, an Atlas statement said.
    Atlas, the Philippines' biggest copper producer, said it
had been hit by depressed world copper prices. It reported a
net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986,
compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.
    The company said it had been able to cut its losses because
its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of Cebu
started in the second half of 1986.
    Atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition
by Bond of the company's existing bank loans and their
restructuring into a gold loan.
    A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in
October last year said Bond would acquire Atlas' total loans of
275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.
    Atlas said the two sides were also discussing equity
infusion into Atlas and the creation of a development fund for
further exploration and development of the company's gold
properties in the central province of Masbate.
    Wilson Banks, general manager of &lt;Bond Corp International
Ltd&gt; in Hong Kong, told Reuters the Atlas statement on the
negotiations was ""reasonably accurate.""
    Banks said Bond Corp was seriously considering several
investments in the Philippines but did not give details.
    In its statement, Atlas said development of the pre-World
War Two underground mines in Masbate had been accelerated and
the ore tonnage had increased, extending the operation's life
at least until 1993.

<title>JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.</title>
<author>    By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 8 - </dateline>Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by
U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will
tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that
liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,
a senior ministry official said.
    ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives
by other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named,
said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and
it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise
its farm import market,"" he said.
    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.
Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open
its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to
protect local farmers.
    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat
exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.
End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.
    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to
visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask
Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and
remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.
    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market
share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has
been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year
beef accord next March 31.
    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales
from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports
from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although
the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.
    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its
beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain
imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.
    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when
Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has
the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.
Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing
some one billion dlrs in new business.
    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import
controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,
purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,
prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.
    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's
top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove
residual import restrictions on agricultural products.
    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional
reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue
should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the
industrial sector.
    ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these
issues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the official
said.

<title>SOUTH KOREA MOVES TO SLOW GROWTH OF TRADE SURPLUS</title>
<author>    By Moon Ihlwan, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    SEOUL, April 8 - </dateline>South Korea's trade surplus is growing too
fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it
down, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.
    He told a press conference the government planned to
increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market
to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold
the surplus ""at a proper level.""
    But he said the government would not allow the won to
appreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has
been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.
    The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with
the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3
billion dlrs in 1985.
    Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects
were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government
would try to hold the current account surplus to around five
billion dlrs a year for the next five years.
    ""Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five
billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in
exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now
the surplus is growing faster than we expected,"" he said.
    Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35
pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this
year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.
    Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to a
surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr
deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the
country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first
time.
    South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs
in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest
in Asia.
    ""This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the
major constraints on our development... Last year was a major
turning point for the Korean economy,"" Kim said.
    Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of
foreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from
about 50 pct in 1986.
    ""The government, however, does not want to accelerate
reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,"" he
said.
    Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation
and lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,
particularly the United States.
    ""We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but
we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a
proper level,"" Kim said.

<dateline>    OSLO, April 8 - </dateline>Citibank A/S &lt;CCI.N&gt;, the Norwegian
subsidiary of the U.S.-based bank, said it made a net loss of
just over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers
said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.
    Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told
Reuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries
operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for
investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic
slump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.
    Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in
Norway since 1985.
    Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway's
second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved
later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would
make profit this year.
    Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but
Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned
liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a
steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank's &lt;CMB.N&gt;
subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy
losses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking.

<title>VIEILLE MONTAGNE SAYS 1986 CONDITIONS UNFAVOURABLE</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, April 8 - </dateline>A sharp fall in the dollar price of
zinc and the depreciation of the U.S. Currency created
unfavourable economic conditions for Vieille Montagne SA
&lt;VMNB.BR&gt; in 1986.
    It said in a statement that the two factors led to a
squeeze on refining margins and an 18.24 pct fall in sales and
services income despite an unchanged level of activity.
    Vieille Montagne, which is actively pursuing a
restructuring program, reported a 198 mln franc net loss, after
187 mln francs in provisions for the closure of an electrolysis
plant, compared with a 250 mln franc net profit in 1985.

<title>JAPAN GIVEN LITTLE HOPE OF AVOIDING U.S. SANCTIONS</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 8 - </dateline>A top U.S. Official said Japan has little

<title>EC SUGAR TENDER HARD TO PREDICT - LONDON TRADE</title>

<title>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING</title>
<author>    By Peter Bale, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, April 8 - </dateline>Australian markets are booming as foreign
fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and
other traditional markets, analysts said.
    High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and
an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of
fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and
U.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.
    Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in
and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they
diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.
    A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in
the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the
currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.
    Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital
are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily
inquiries from Japan and the United States.
    ""These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about
and they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending
up here with the attraction of high interest rates and
reasonable currency stability,"" National Australia Bank Ltd
economist Brian Hamley said.
    ""There is a 'flight to quality',"" Hamley said. ""Australia may
not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too
many other countries where you'd want to put your money.""
    The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting
investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against
the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.
    ""We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.
Where some people would be concerned about the value of the
U.S. Dollar,"" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose
said. ""Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap
and the currency looks stable?""
    But turning that capital into more permanent productive
investment depends on government economic policy, he said.
    ""It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the
direction in the economy,"" Buttrose said, adding that offshore
investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough
economic statement on May 14.
    While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding
interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as
easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were
badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar
and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.
    ""It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be
delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one
might see a substantial outflow,"" Buttrose said.
    Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough
economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and
stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.
    ""They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think
they would like to leave the money here,"" Buttrose said.
    Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased
interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield
Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.
    Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an
element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency
policy when he said authorities could not take their ""eyes off
the yen"" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.
    Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked
successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar
within the range of 100 to 103 yen.
    Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the
Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a
trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.
    Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming
Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other
markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the
weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into
equities, particularly in the gold sector.
    The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3
today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while
the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the
same period.
    The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese
companies that have invested heavily in the United States in
recent years turning their attention to undervalued real
estate, particularly in the tourism field.
    Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star
Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs
as indicative of the type of property being sought.
    ""They think they find good value real estate here which,
with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of
investment Australia needs,"" Buttrose added.

forces. ""The U.S. Has excessive expectations. To stabilise
supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess
inventories since 1985 will take some time,"" he said.
    Kuroda also laid part of the blame for low U.S. Chip sales

<title>JARDINE MATHESON REPLACES ""B"" SHARE BY BONUS ISSUE</title>
<dateline>    HONG KONG, April 8 - </dateline>Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd
&lt;JARD.HK&gt; said it will withdraw the previously announced
four-for-one bonus issue of ""B"" shares and replace it by a
two-for-five bonus issue of ordinary shares.
    A statement said the firm expects to pay total dividends
for 1987 of not less than 40 cents a share on the expanded
capital.
    Jardine Matheson decided to withdraw its issue because of a
joint announcement earlier today by Ronald Li, chairman of the
Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, and Securities Commissioner Ray
Astin, that the listings of new ""B"" shares would be barred.
    The official announcement said this will include the

would benefit shareholders, and regret that they will not be
given the opportunity to vote on the matter at this stage.""
    Keswick said the ""B"" share issue will benefit Jardine
Matheson's shareholders by giving the firm flexibility to issue
ordinary shares for expansion in future without diluting

<title>SAN MIGUEL DEAL HIT BY MORE LAWSUITS</title>
<dateline>    MANILA, April 8 - </dateline>A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) &lt;SANM.MN&gt;
to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut
Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources
in the Philippine food and brewery company said.
    A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB
from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's
outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on
April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former
chairman of both SMC and UCPB.
    Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)
and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.
    Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and
represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's
plans to sell the shares to SMC were ""a serious breach of
fiduciary duties.""
    The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be
held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a
government nominee on the company's board.
    De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,
asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by
the company's board.
    On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the
sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per
share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained
earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the
purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of
dividends.
    De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate
an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt
to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon
del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would
boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.
    In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier
suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres
Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.
    De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming
last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong
subsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp&gt; for a down payment on the shares.
The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board
meeting.
    An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to
resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by
April 15.
    ""The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of
a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard
of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early
disposition of the sequestered shares,"" San Miguel Corp said in
a statement.
    ""Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have
reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of
payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the
government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement
of the controversy by April 15,"" the statement added.
    A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on
Cojuangco's court petition, adding: ""Any statement coming from
us might be interpreted as adversarial.""
    Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which
sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible
to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United
States citizen.
    The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln ""A"" shares,
which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln ""B"" shares which
are available to foreign buyers.
    SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among
prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by
the &lt;A.Soriano&gt; group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed
institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers
in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.
    The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on
Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were
owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President
Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the
U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend
announced last June.
    ""We have no objection to Soriano buying the ""B"" shares,"" Diaz
told Reuters. ""But everything is on hold now.""
    The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy
would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders'
meeting, scheduled for May 14.
    San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion
pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in
1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of
700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.

<title>RAIN BOOSTS CENTRAL QUEENSLAND SUGAR CANE CROP</title>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, April 8 - </dateline>Good rains of one to four inches in the
past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in
the Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland's central coast, an
Australian Sugar Producers' Association spokesman said.
    As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a
severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since
December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet
season.
    Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are
beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth
since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.
    Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better
than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman
said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain
is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.
    Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region
and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and
some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.
    Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled
towards the end of May, he said.
    The cane crush normally runs from June to December.

17.7 billion guilders in 1986 from 24.1 billion in 1985.
    The company said 1986 dividend, which will be paid to the
Dutch state in its capacity of the firm's sole shareholder,
would be raised to 98 mln guilders from 70 mln guilders in
1985.
    In an initial comment on its 1986 results, DSM said the
drop in 1986 turnover had been caused mainly by losses in the
company's fertilizer division.

<title>POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </dateline>Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation
of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German
economic growth.
    In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs
here, Poehl said ""It would be an extremely risky policy to aim
for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to
correct the trade deficit.""
    He said the United States could face a vicious circle of
depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that
route.
    Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet
U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,
accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating
above-target money supply growth.
    He said he would have been happy to have brought forward
five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to
the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced
political constraints getting such measures through the upper
house of the West German parliament.
    But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could
accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.
    Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about
one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial
erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing
demand at home.
    ""A further appreciation of the mark could even be an
obstacle to further growth,"" he said.
    Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply
growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and
because external factors, including low oil prices and
favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.
    But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma
over monetary policy.
    The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the
reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany
was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.
    ""For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more
on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary
money supply. But we must be very careful,"" he said.
    He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's
trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as
the United States.
    Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary
officials of major industrialized countries, saying the
importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange
rates had been underestimated.
    All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the
right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he
said.
    ""This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the
part of our American colleagues,"" he said.
    But he said there was still a danger that the correction of
the dollar's value could overshoot.

Inc said it expects to report a loss of 1,300,000 dlrs to

investment in research and manufacturing and a scaleup of
production.
    The company said research spending is running 50 to 60 pct

quickly as possible, and increased expenditures are expected to
continue for several more quarters.  It said operating results
will fluctuate quarter to quarter, depending on the timing of
significant payments from commercial partners.
    In the first three months of 1986, the company lost 150,000
dlrs.  The company changed its fiscal year in 1986 to a
calendar year from a year ending November 30.  For the first

    Chesebrough's footwear and tennis racket businesses are

which is wholly-owned, was limited, he added. Nine month sales
to September 1986 were about 1.2 billion dlrs.

    The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented

The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration

<title>INDEPENDENT CHAIRMAN FOR DUTCH CARGO DISPUTE</title>
<dateline>    ROTTERDAM, April 8 - </dateline>The two sides in the Rotterdam port
general cargo dispute have agreed to appoint an independent
chairman, Han Lammers, to preside over future meetings,
employers' spokesman Gerard Zeebregts said.
    Lammers, Queen's Commissioner for the province of
Flevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up an
agenda and procedures for meetings between the employers and
unions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies.
    Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 in
protest at employers' proposals for 350 redundancies from the
4,000-strong workforce this year.
    The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV on
March 13 following an Amsterdam court's interim injunction
against the redundancies on procedural grounds.
    The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 but
Zeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against the
employers and they were therefore very likely to restart the
complicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future.
    Meanwhile, the dispute over a new work-practice agreement
in the port's grain sector continued, with 30 maintenance
workers on strike, although loading was not affected, a
spokesman for Graan Elevator Mij, the largest employer in the
sector, said.
    The employers have written to the union asking it to
reconsider its position and a meeting of union members has been
called for tomorrow.

<title>PROXMIRE OUTLINES INSIDER TRADING LEGISLATION</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </dateline>Senate Banking Committee Chairman
William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce
legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of
corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.
    Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,
Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased
the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.
    ""We are proposing legislation that would provide for more
disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would
insure that takeovers are properly financed,"" he said.
    Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold
for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a
investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a
company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within
10 days, Proxmire said.
    In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement
that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have
to filed with the SEC.
    Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to
prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in
knowing about coming takeover attempts.
    Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a
tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60
business days from the current 20 business days.
    His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring
company violated the time period on the tender offer.
    To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire
said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin
requirments are properly enforced.
    The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement
for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally
enforced in hostile takeovers.
    Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover
declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without
actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.
    He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for
failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin
requirements.
    The bill also would require more disclose when several
investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.
    ""When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know
about it,"" Proxmire said.
    Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain
towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all
shareholders recieve equal treatment.
    He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover
defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.
    Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this
month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.
    He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this
year.

<title>BANKERS TRUST &lt;BT&gt; PUTS BRAZIL ON NON-ACCRUAL</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </dateline>Bankers Trust New York Corp said it has
placed its approximately 540 mln dlrs of medium- and long-term
loans to Brazil on non-accrual status and that first-quarter
net income will be reduced by about seven mln dlrs as a result.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
of medium- and long-term debt on February 22.
    U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop
accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,
but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of ""the high
potential of a continued suspension that would result in
reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987.""
    Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are
received for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated that
full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.
    Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiations
between Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the
resumption of interest payments.
    The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when central
bank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a
90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that
matures on April 15.

<title>STOLTENBERG SEES MOVES TO STRENGTHEN PARIS ACCORD</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </dateline>West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries
would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on
stabilizing foreign exchange rates.
    Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness
of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and
Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.
    But he declined to say what measures would be discussed
ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later
today.
    Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said
the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre
accord, had been underestimated.
    Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major
countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual
meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,
marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major
trading partners.
    ""There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord,"" he
said. ""We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do
not want to discuss that here.
    Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a
""slight firming"" of the yen against the dollar.
    And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged
since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell
marks to support the dollar.
    ""The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market,"" he
said.
    Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the
bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be
accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.
    Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its
pledges for economic stimulation.
    ""And we will have to see if the United States is able to do
what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit --
and get it through Congress,"" he added.
    Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further
fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against
the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis.
    ""You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And
it is not just a German problem, it is a European problem,"" he
said.

<title>MEAD &lt;MEA&gt; EXPECTS IMPROVED EARNINGS THIS YEAR</title>
<dateline>    DAYTON, Ohio, April 8 - </dateline>Mead Corp said the outlook for its
major paper markets looks strong for the second quarter and
augurs well for its earnings in 1987.
    ""The generally strong outlook bodes well for significantly
improved earnings this year,"" Burnell Roberts, chairman and
chief executive officer said.
    Earlier, the company reported first quarter earnings of
34.2 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share, versus 20.3 mln dlrs, or
65 cts a share, in last year's first quarter.
    In 1986 the company reported earnings from continuing
operations of 109.3 mln dlrs, or 3.50 dlrs a share.
    Mead said its first quarter benefitted from stronger market
conditions and improved operations.
    ""The combination of capital improvement programs and more
employee involvement has been paying off throughout our paper
operations,"" Roberts said.
    He added that Mead's pulp and paperboard businesses are
operating well as prices have improved and strong demand has
placed most products in a sold-out position through the middle
of the year.
    Mead said sales of its unbleached coated paperboard was
particularly strong, up 13 pct versus the first quarter 1986.

<title>DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED</title>
<dateline>    ROTTERDAM, April 8 - </dateline>Roughly half of this year's expected
130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,
a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the
Netherlands, told Reuters.
    Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date
for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April
23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman
added.
    ""It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can
expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the
crop is off to a very good start,"" he said.
    Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600
hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of
white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined ""A""
and ""B"" quota of 872,000 tonnes.
    This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been
introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000
hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000
tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota ""C"" sugar produced.
    Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been
allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being
boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.

<title>VOLKSWAGEN DIVIDEND DECISION DUE TOMORROW</title>
<dateline>    WOLFSBURG, West Germany, April 8 - </dateline>Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F&gt;,
VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986
dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per
ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of
a suspected foreign currency fraud.
    A spokesman said VW's supervisory board will meet tomorrow
to discuss the payout.  A statement will be made afterwards.
    VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach
their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln
marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually
the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit.
    When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it
said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark
dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would
be proposed for the company's new preference shares.
    Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of
the management board proposal as virtually a formality.
""Anything else would be more than a surprise,"" one said.
    Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to
maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at
around three billion marks at end-1985.

<title>ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE</title>
<dateline>    LUSAKA, April 8 - </dateline>The Zambian government has no immediate
plans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of
maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an
official of the ruling party said.
    Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for
refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in
which at least 15 people died.
    That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later
revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.
    However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67
dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price
increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,
a practice discouraged by the IMF.
    ""There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of
meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the
demands of the IMF and those of the people,"" a Ministry of
Agriculture economist said.

<title>FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED</title>
<author>    By Manuel Villanueva</author>
<dateline>    BUENOS AIRES, April 8 - </dateline>Argentine grain producers adjusted
their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop
downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the
end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.
    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates
had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which
has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.
    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,
producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain
could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.
    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27
millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in
Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in
Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.
    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.
    Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce
rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the
crops, including soybean.
    However, as the lands began drying later in the week
harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40
pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.
    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested
material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield
estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.
    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at
2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast
last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of
4.1 mln.
    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9
to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.
    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area
sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will
begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.
    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at
9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated
previously.
    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln
tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and
21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln
tonnes.
    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to
seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.
    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in
Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and
Buenos Aires in mid-April.
    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3
to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.
    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln
tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,
and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2
mln tonne crop.
    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,
remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5
pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for
1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of
7.1 mln.
    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln
to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln
sown in 1985/86.
    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some
areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some
experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas
making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on
this were not available.
    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which
will be sown between May and August or September, has so far
not been as intense as in previous years.

<title>DOMINION CALLS BURLINGTON &lt;BUR&gt; REPORT RUMOR</title>
<dateline>    MONTREAL, April 8 - </dateline>&lt;Dominion Textile Inc&gt; considers a
published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington
Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the
company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said.
    ""As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they
are rumors and we're not commenting on rumors,"" spokesman Michel
Dufour told Reuters in response to a query.
    ""All the information that has been given out publicly is
that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an
acquisition that big...probably based on that people are
starting all sorts of rumors,"" he said.
    Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a
rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment
further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell
was out of town and unavailable for comment.
    Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln-
U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln-
U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition.
    Dufour said the company has been negotiating with ""many""
U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington
Industries was one of them.
    Burlington's stock rose sharply this morning on the report,
which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher
Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a
takeover offer.
    Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1
mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has
repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. 
   The company has said it plans to diversify into new product
and market areas in addition to expanding its textile
operations.

<title>J.P. MORGAN &lt;JPM&gt; NET HURT BY BRAZIL, TRADING</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </dateline>J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its
first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its
previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status
its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.
    That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest
payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20
mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the
first three months of 1986.
    Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities
underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln
dlrs in the year-earlier period.
    In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading
losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and
underwriting of Euromarket securities.
    Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained
difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering
heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether
Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.
    On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan
losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign
exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and
trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.
    Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and
commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net
investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.
    Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first
quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell
to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.
    If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means
that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are
actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9
mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume
payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.
    After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for
credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared
with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.
    It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after
charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49
mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.
    Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were
583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year
earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from
303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to
personnel costs, Morgan said.

<title>BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS</title>
<dateline>    SAO PAULO, April 8 - </dateline>Storage problems with Brazil's record
grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln
tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.
    Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,
told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this
year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.
    He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in
harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage
problems.
    Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,
theoretically sufficient for the crop.
    But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly
distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do
Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were
responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.
    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West
growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage
capacity.
    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and
maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains
production but only 20 pct of its storage space.
    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,
there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to
storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for
storing loose grain, Brito said.
    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the
crops.
    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop
has been evident from television reports, which have shown
enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.

<dateline>    LONDON, April 8 - </dateline>Exchanges and telecommunications
authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free
dissemination of information to the investment and banking
communities, Reuters Holdings Plc &lt;RTRS.L&gt; chairman Sir
Christopher Hogg said.
    In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations
had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges
for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data
through Reuter services.
    ""Many other markets maintain restrictions,"" he added.
    Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that
information restrictions protected their interests.
    In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the
distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage
to their own commercial information businesses.
    He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the
telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect
their state monopolies at the expense of other economic
sectors.
    ""Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such
countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire
economies are put at a competitive disadvantage,"" he added.
    Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from
the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues
to 620.9 mln stg.

consolidated profit for its Agrimont Group, formed in June
1986, totalled 1.5 billion lire in 1986.
    Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedison's
Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a
net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs
of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value
of inventory due to falling market prices, Montedison said.
    Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps
to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said.
    The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable
fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of
international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S
where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division.
    In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont
maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in
1986, Montedison said.

<title>TALKING POINT/BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES &lt;BUR&gt;</title>
<author>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    New York, April 8 - </dateline>The largest U.S. textile maker focused
on its own business as its competitors found merger partners,
but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself
into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.
    The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose
4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and
Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct
stake.
    A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly
acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover
offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for
Montreal-based Dominion called the report just ""rumors.""
    Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.
    Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of
the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if
Burlington actually came into play.
    Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,
added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it
was looking for a takeover in the U.S.
    Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills
and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for
a U.S. acquisition.
    A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer
has been negotiating with ""many"" U.S. textile companies, but
would not say whether Burlington was among them.
    ""There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not
unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the
housecleaning they've done,"" said Eileen Gormley of Thomson
McKinnon.
    Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets
and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs
last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its
operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign
competition, Gormley said.
    ""They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,""
said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial
fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets
and other fabric to the auto industry.
    ""In the past, they just spent and never realized the return
on the outlays they did make,"" she said.
    ""You look at their record over the year, and I think
they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the
past,"" Gormley said.
     She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up
from 2.01 dlrs per share.
    Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington
at its current levels.
    Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends
selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50
dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings
basis.
    Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been
placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.
    ""After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people
don't find him very credible anymore,"" said one arbitrager.
    Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing
managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if
he doesn't win the target company.
    Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky
Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying
Ponderosa Inc.
    The stocks of other textile makers rose along with
Burlington.
    J.P. Stevens &lt;STN&gt; climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest
Cannon Inc &lt;FLD&gt;, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and
Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc &lt;WPM&gt;
rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.

<title>JAPAN IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO AVERT TARIFFS</title>
<author>    By Robert Trautman, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </dateline>Senior Japanese officials tomorrow
open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch
effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide
variety of Japanese electronic exports.
    Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of
meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael
Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.
    The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in
retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to
end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and
to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.
    They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,
including television and audio equipment and computers.
    Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little
likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct
duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.
    President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27
after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986
U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that
Japan was not honoring the agreement.
    In making the annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed to
the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to
provide American industry with free and fair trade.""
    Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's
semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured
the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has
complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.
    Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive
trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's
inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last
year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.
    About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.
    Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to
adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.
    Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals
but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.
    He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's
decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense
of MITI's power to control Japanese traders.
    ""The United States has excessive expectations.,"" he said. To
stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by
excess inventories since 1985 will take some time.""
    He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough
in trying to sell in the Japanese market.

sent propsective customers a confidential report describing its

    Hoechst Celanese was formed Feb 27 by the merger of

of the combined companies would be divested, it said.

<title>HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION</title>
<author>    By Emma Robson, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    AMSTERDAM, April 8 - </dateline>Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped
to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to
the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite
continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts
to extend world penetration.
    Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln
guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.
    Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's
leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,
said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.
    The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,
Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,
where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.
    Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker
foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.
    Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the
increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila
S.A.&gt; to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly
in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The
company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in
restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.
    Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit
next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had
already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.
    Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer
into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer
market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. ""We
have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important
point,"" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken
had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.
    ""The question is not if we want to penetrate the German
market, but how we are to do it,"" van Schaik said, adding that
while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a
taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very
regionalized.
     Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for
African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most
important beer growth markets in the long term.
     He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with
majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was
hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.
    Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters
per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions
and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total
1986 sales.
    On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price
of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists
have been looking at other possibilities.
    To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on
the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which
had sold successfully, Coebergh said.
    Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw
materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were
popular in Rwanda . ""This is a possibility, but we could not
possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,"" Coebergh said.
    Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to
penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a
contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.
    But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's
market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that
are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western
money.

<title>J.P. MORGAN&lt;JPM&gt; SAYS DLR MAY PREVENT FED EASING</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </dateline>The relatively high level of real U.S.
interest rates suggests that there is scope for further
declines in money market rates, but the Federal Reserve is
unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains
volatile, said J.P. Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston.
    He said in response to a reporter's question after the
bank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline
further but, ""I don't think the Fed is going to encourage that
as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are.""
    On the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of the
dollar, he did not see rates going much higher.
    He said that Morgan's recent rise in its prime lending rate
was ""purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of
rates.""
    Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the U.S.
economy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth this
year.
    He also said that as a consequence of the dollar's decline
and oil price rises, inflation would rise ""moderately"" to a 3.5
to four pct rate in 1987.

<title>MEDTRONIC &lt;MDT&gt; SEES 15 PCT EARNINGS GROWTH</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </dateline>Medtronic Inc said it sees 15 pct
growth in sales and earnings for the year ending April 30,
1988.
    At an analysts meeting here the company said that for the
year ending April 30, 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs, or
about 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs.
    In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs,
or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs.
    Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company will
improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and
expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line.
    Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per
share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have
heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988.
    He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its
businesses and not in its dividends. ""Shareholders are better
off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends
or share repurchases,"" he said.
    Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the total
worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988,
from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.
    He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic
products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and
lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will
double that by 1995.
    Wallin said, ""Our objective is to get a hold of new
products and start building market share if we have to beg,
borrow or steal to get into new markets.""
    In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with
a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators
also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and
a needless overprescription of pacemakers.
    ""We have no knowledge of any major problems in our
pacemakers or leads,"" Wallin said. ""We intend to re-establish
our company as the quality leader in the industry.""
    Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, said
the company intends to diversify internally and through
acquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise,
such as drug delivery systems.
    Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does
not include dilutions from acquisitions. ""We hope to have some
safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions
from an acquisition.""
    Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity
in rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988.
    The company markets Activitrax, the first single chamber
pacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physical
activity.
    Siemens AG, a West German company, is also developing a
rate responsive pacemaker.

<title>SHOWBOAT &lt;SBO&gt; TO TAKE CHARGE, SEES 3RD QTR LOSS</title>
<dateline>    ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., April 8 - </dateline>Showboat Inc will take a
charge of 19 to 20 mln dlrs pretax against results for the
third quarter ended March 31, director and assistant to the
president J. Kell Houssels III told Reuters.
    He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of
its recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casino
and Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarter
and probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well.
    But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988
should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the
contribution of the new Atlantic City facility.
    Showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year's third
quarter.  For all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5,769,000 dlrs.
    Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the Atlantic
City hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interest
expenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility
directly against income rather than capitalizing the interest
as it had been able to do previously.
    Showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter and
gaming began last Thursday on a regular basis after test gaming
was completed earlier in the week.

<title>SECURITY PACIFIC &lt;SPC&gt; LOANS PUT ON NON-ACCRUAL</title>
<dateline>    LOS ANGELES, April 8 - </dateline>Security Pacific Corp said it is
placing medium and long-term loans to Brazil and Ecuador on a
non-accrual basis as of March 31, a move that will reduce first
quarter earnings by 7.2 mln dlrs, or nine cts per share, after
taxes.
    Despite the anticipated reduction to quarterly earnings,
Security Pacific said it still expects to report first quarter
earnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs, or 1.11 dlrs per share
reported for the first quarter of 1986.
    The bank holding company said the action affects 401 mln
dlrs of loans to Brazil and 73 mln of loans to Ecuador.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
of medium- and long-term debt on February 20.
    Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billion
dlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks since
February.
    In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest payments
for the rest of the year because of an earthquake which halted
the export of oil, which accounts for about 75 pct the
country's export revenues.
    In its announcement, Security Pacific said it will record
interest income only as it is received in cash.
    The company also said it believes that Brazil will reach an
agreement with its banks and that interest payments will resume
later in 1987.
    The Brazilian negotiations resume on Friday in New York
when Central Bank Governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask
banks for a 90-day roll-over of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term
debt that matures on April 15.

<title>UNION TEXAS OIL RESERVES DROPPED IN 1986</title>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, April 8 - </dateline>Union Texas Petroleum said its worldwide
proved reserves fell to 511 mln barrels of oil equivalent at
the end of 1986 from 555 mln barrels reported in 1985.
    In its newly released annual report, Union Texas said it
replaced about 71 pct of its production of 56 mln barrels of
oil equivalent last year after taking into account the sale of
27 mln barrels of U.S. reserves.
    Union Texas, the nation's largest independent oil and gas
producer based on revenues, is a privately-held company owned
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co and Allied-Signal Inc &lt;ALD&gt;.
    The Houston-based company said it lost 57.5 mln dlrs on
1.26 billion dlrs in sales last year, compared to profits of
165 mln dlrs on 2.04 billion dlrs in sales in 1985.
    Union Texas said it received an average of 13.35 dlrs per
barrel for its international oil production and 2.99 dlrs per
mcf for its foreign natural gas sales. The majority of the
company's total energy production is in the United Kingdom,
Indonesia and Pakistan.
    In the United States, Union Texas said it completed

<title>UAL &lt;UAL&gt; MAY RESPOND TO PILOTS TODAY</title>
<dateline>    New York, April 8 - </dateline>UAL Inc may have a response this
afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United
Airlines unit, a UAL spokesman said.
    ""Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we
need to get a clarification out,"" the spokesman said, adding
that there was a ""50-50"" chance a statement would be released
today.
    The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for
2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.
    Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several
weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer
Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also
held discussions with its chairman.
    The developer indicated in those talks that he took the
position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.
    Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying
UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2
mln shares.
    ""United has got to consider this proposal. I think the
pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,
but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL
management,"" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.
    Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack
when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz
rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a
strategy to become a travel service company.
    The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union
concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention
on its airline.
    UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its
new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.
    But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has
been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100
dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as
widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe
the stock is in play.
    Market sources have said that although Trump attracted
attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a
catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps
throwing the company into the hands of another buyer.
    ""The first domino is you have an investor with a
considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type
of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,""
said Pettee.
    ""What's interesting is the values are there. There's
something for everybody,"" he said.

1987, Chairman John Meinert told the annual meeting.
    Meinert reiterated an earlier comment that earnings for the
remainder of the year must double the 1986 level to meet that
goal. In fiscal 1986, ended November 30, 1986, Hartmarx
reported earnings of 24.8 mln dlrs, or 1.20 dlrs a share, down
from the prior year's 42.7 mln dlrs, or 2.25 dlrs a share.

first-quarter earnings of 54 cts a share, up from 40 cts a year
ago.
    Meinert told shareholders Hartmarx has no plans to sell any
of its divisions. He added, ""We have the financial capacity to
take advantage of acquisitions.""
    In 1987, Meinert said the company will open five new and 10
redesigned Kuppenheimer direct-to-consumer stores in Atlanta,
Detroit, St. Louis, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.
    He said the company's women's apparel continues to grow,
and Hartmarx has on the drawing board a Briar concept store
which will feature ties, shirts and some tailored clothing.

<title>FED'S HELLER SAYS MONETARY GROWTH TO BE SLOWER</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </dateline>Robert Heller, a member of the
Federal Reserve Board, said he expects ""more modest levels"" of
growth in the money supply this year.
    ""In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a
most desireable development,"" he said in a speech prepared for
delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange,
Calif.
    A text was released in Washington.
    He said the effect of lower inflation and financial
deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.
    ""Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest
levels,"" Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed
after mid-January.
    ""I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates
were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as
well,"" he added.
    Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.
    ""The pricing behavior of American producers in response to
price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial
for our economic future,"" he said.
    Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising
import prices would ""generalize the inflationary forces
emanating from the foreign trade sector"" and might not gain more
market share for U.S. producers.
    ""A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be
the result of such a behavior pattern,"" Heller warned.
    He said ""we at the Federal Reserve will have to be
disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy."" 
    Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal
discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather
than new taxes.
    ""The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle
inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in
international markets,"" Heller said.
    He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct
during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.
    A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with
Canada ""would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American
producers to compete more effectively in that country,"" Heller
said.

<title>CHRYSLER &lt;C&gt; RENAULT DELAY AM MOTORS &lt;AMO&gt; PACT</title>
<dateline>    DETROIT, April 8 - </dateline>Chrysler Corp and Regie Natiionale des
Usines Renault said they agreed to extend by up to two weeks
the period for reaching definitive agreement on Chrysler's
proposed 1.5 billion dlr takeover of American Motors Corp.
    The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault on
March nine set April nine as the target date for completing
negotiations.
    However, the letter also allowed room for an extension of
that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached.
    The two companies said they ""now plan to complete work by
April 23.""
    Chrysler and Renault said, ""Given the complex nature of the
deal, the need for additional time was to be expected.""
    The March letter of intent between the two companies says
that Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date
""in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discovers
an unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence'
investigation of the company,"" referring to American Motors.
    A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem
had cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company's
statement that more time was needed because the talks are
complex. ""That is our definition of the delay,"" she said.
    Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault,
their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine or
when an agreement was reached. But the letter could be amendend
by a written agreement by both companies.
    The Chrysler spokeswoman said, ""We are still working toward
a definitive agreement."" Said another Chrysler official who is
not part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were in
trouble: ""There are no glitches.""
    Analysts also downplayed the significance of the delay. ""I
can't visualize where they wouldn't want it to be done,"" said
Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette analyst Richard Henderson.

<title>GENERAL ELECTRIC &lt;GE&gt; 1ST QTR HELPED BY RCA</title>
<dateline>    FAIRFIELD, Conn., April 8 - </dateline>General Electric Corp said its
first quarter results were significantly higher due to the
strong results of RCA, which was acquired last year.
    General Electric also attibuted continued strong
performances in plastics, major appliances and the Employers
Reinsurance Corp for its strong quarter.
    GE recorded net earnings for the first quarter 1987 of 624
mln dlrs, or 1.37 dls per shr, up 16 pct from 537 mln dlrs, or
1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago.
    General Electric chairman John Welch Jr reiterated the
company's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit GE
earnings growth for the year. He said the first quarter results
are in line with those expectations.
    General Electric cited the strong results in TV network and
station operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which was
not part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason for
its strong earnings.
    It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was
much higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipments
than the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.
    Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's first
quarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion of
RCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said.
    In addition, consumer products revenues were up from last
year, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products.
    General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln
dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were
charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. It
added that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs after
taxes from an inventory accounting change.
    And technical products revenues and operating profit were
ahead of last year, led by a strong increases in medical
systems volume and the inclusion this year of RCA's
communications and related services.

<title>WOJNILOWER SEES DROP IN U.S. INTEREST RATES</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </dateline>The Federal Reserve will promote lower
interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth,
First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said.
    As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against
inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without
subverting national U.S. economic policy.
    ""On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and,
because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States
decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their
commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its
part by moving rates down,"" Wojnilower said in a report.
    ""Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or
seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants
have seen little to fear,"" Wojnilower said.
    He said last week's ""hiccup"" in money and currency rates
and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese
window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.
    Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average
economic growth in the first quarter. However, the pick-up

a net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billion
dlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46
billion in 1985.
    In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest Pipeline
Corp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that are
among the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07
dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gas
reserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feet
in 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.
    The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which has
less take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, should
show improvement in its 1987 operating results because of
changes tariff and federal tax rates.
    The company's gas marketing business is expected to have
somewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in its
operating region, the annual report said. The gas marketing
unit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year.
    Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in its
debt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mln
dlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co and
proceeds from the sale and leaseback of Williams
Telecommunications Co. The telecommunications business, a
2,000-mile fiber optic system for long distance use, will not
be profitable until late 1988, Williams said.

financial results were qualified by its auditors, according to

    ""...there are conditions which may indicate that the

auditors Deloitte Haskins and Sells said in Hawkeye's annual

    Hawkeye reported a 1986 loss of almost 59 mln dlrs, citing
an increase in its loan loss provision to 34.7 mln dlrs and
restructuring costs of 27 mln dlrs.
    However, Hawkeye, with assets of 1.09 billion dlrs at 1986
year end, said it expects ""to have sufficient cash to meet its
obligations for the next 12-month period.""
    Last July the bank holding company reached a debt
restructuring agreement which identifed 17 bank subsidiaries
and five non-bank operations for disposition.
    ""The restructuring has improved Hawkeye's financial
condition, but it does not assure that Hawkeye will be able to
survive as a going concern,"" the report said.
    Hawkeye's survival will depend on its ability to comply
with provisions of the debt restructuring and regulatory

    After the five years are up, ""under certain circumstances
the shares of Encor may be required to be disposed,"" the company

<title>DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT</title>
<author>    By Irwin Arieff</author>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </dateline>Financial analysts say they are
pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal
budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help
improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.
    The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow
to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming
fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.
    Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan
that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next
year.
        ""In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is
infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little
impact on the economy and the trade deficit,"" said Stanley
Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.
    ""At best, it will have a small positive effect,"" Collander
said in an interview.
    Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly
told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way
to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease
some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.
    The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade
imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker
has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught
with danger.
    Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as
imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign
capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.
    In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other
major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of
the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates
should be stabilized at around current levels.
    As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to
take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States
agreed to cut its budget deficit.
    The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a
way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is
to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.
    ""If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else
you do is going to be counterproductive,"" Volcker said in recent
testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
    Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the
government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit
supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or
to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United
States.
    Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the
current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.
    Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed
that any deficit reduction was better than none.
    But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were 
not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it
needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar
from plunging further in world exchange markets.
    ""There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if
your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the
Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer
is, it's not enough,"" Silvia told Reuters.
    The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's
most vexing and persistent problems.
    The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet
little indication that this year's figure will be any lower,
though administration officials have predicted it will drop by
about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.
    In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep
worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the
federal budget.
    On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not
attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for
the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced
budget law.
    While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for
next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget
Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall
short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.
    ""For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the
most you're going to get"" out of Congress at the present time,
said Touche Ross's Collander. ""To do something more than that
would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.""
    Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up
short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.
    ""To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable
reduction level,"" he explained. ""Anything less than that will now
look like a failure to Wall Street.""
    The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would
lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year
beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting
defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their
anticipated spending levels for next year.
    The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of
nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new 
taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.

<title>MORE AMERICAN BRANDS &lt;AMB&gt; ACQUISITIONS SEEN</title>
<author>    By PATTI DOMM, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </dateline>American Brands Inc's 545 mln dlrs
acquisition of National Distillers and Chemical Corp's liquor
business is expected to be one of a series of acquisitions by
the tobacco company, analysts said.
     ""They were very frustrated with their inability to get
Chesebrough. They said they were looking for an acquisition. It
doesn't surprise me that they came up with another one,"" said
Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch and Co.
    American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion
dlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed to
buy the company. But since then, Wall Street has been
speculating that American Brands would find another candidate
to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco.
    ""This is just typical,"" said George Thompson of
Prudential-Bache securities. ""There's going to be more to come
here. American Brands had to make an acquisition because
tobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their position
is a little less favorable than Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds,""
he said.
cash flow from its low growth tobacco, but the tobacco business
does require great amounts of capital expenditures. It can
therefore use its funds to make acquisitions. Analysts said the
National Distillers' spirits company, which makes Gilbey's gin
and vodka, Old Grandad and Old Crow whiskey, is not quite the
type of acquisition they envisioned.
    ""The distilled spirits business has been in a steady
gradual decline for sometime, as has the tobacco business,""
said Thompson.

<title>BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION</title>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, April 8 - </dateline>Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler
called on central banks of major industrialised nations to
cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.
    In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released
here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was
protectionism and control on capital movements.
    ""Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market
transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have
them,"" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would
have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop
to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.
    Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets
had parted company with transactions in goods, services and
investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that
determined market trends.
    Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to
grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates
would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.
    ""In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
mounting economic activity,"" Koehler said.
    The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.
Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation
going by talking the dollar down posed problems.
    The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep
rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost
of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports
to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to
make itself felt compared with the price effect.
    ""Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going
further than would be necessary to adjust the current account
over the medium term,"" Koehler said.
    A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur
only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.
In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should
rise faster than GNP.
    ""In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,"" Koehler said.
    If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be
prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by
an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..
    But only if there was an appropriate interest rate
differential would Europe and Japan look for financial
investment in the U.S.
    When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank
had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its
measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.
    Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates
by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading
interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market
and its substantial impact on exchange rates.
    It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of
price stability, economic growth and full employment but also
to tackle international problems like the exchange rate
problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.
    A strategy had to be designed that helped ""the safeguarding
of non-inflationary economic growth in an international
monetary system largely free of disruptions,"" Koehler said.
    Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was
necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed
to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over
the next few years and intervention points should not be set,
because they were only testing points for the market, he said.
    In order to keep the international monetary system free of
disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but
also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.

<title>JAPAN MINISTRY HAS NO COMMENT ON RICE TALKS REPORT</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 9 - </dateline>The Agriculture Ministry declined comment
on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks
on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.
    ""We have no idea about the report and cannot comment,"" a
spokesman told Reuters.
    Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources,
said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its
intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for
farm talks.
    The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue
at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.
    Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff
Control Act.
    Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries about
mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan
will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is
justified, it said.
    The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade
round last September. It will take four years to negotiate.

<title>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY</title>
<author>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 9 - </dateline>Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force
to be reckoned with, political analysts said.
    MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.
And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of
a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,
they said.
    ""The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of
a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,""
said one diplomatic source.
    ""They are a potent political force,"" the diplomatic source
said.
    But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not
always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts
said.
    ""The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not
so internationalized,"" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru
Uchida. ""Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world
community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to
face the situation.""
    Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with
London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep
a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in
Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.
    The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival
groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one
competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now
monopolizes the business.
    It has also opposed a major management role in the planned
merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on
the grounds that no such international precedent exists.
    The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has
threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger
plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open
its telecommunications market.
    Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it
says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car
telephone and satellite communications market.
    Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the
sector it regulates.
    ""What has been happening is an important shift in the
economy which makes the ministry a very important place,"" said
James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory
Service Inc.
    A decision to open the telecommunications industry to
competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted
rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.
    ""With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto
legal framework,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell
Whitten.
    Close links with the powerful political faction of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime
Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the
analysts said.
    ""Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka
faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance
of MPT,"" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of
the influential political group, he added.
    The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to
the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the
Postal Savings System, analysts said.
    MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate
interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial
liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal
Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than
banks, they said.
    Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's
obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized
the ministry as feudal.
    Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting
competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its
wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest
price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.
    But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of
its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world
including Britain, several analysts said.
    ""The United States is really the odd man out,"" Abegglen said.
""For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order
in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable
view,"" he said.

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </dateline>Following is the text of a statement
by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting
yesterday.
    1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of
seven major industrial countries met today.
    They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of

also participated in the meeting.
    2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to
the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,
and noted the progress achieved in implementing the
undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.
    They agreed, however, that further actions will be
essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.
    In this connection they welcomed the proposals just
announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan
for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's
economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
    The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further
open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.
    3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that
around current levels their currencies are within ranges
broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic
policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.
    In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation
of the Louvre Agreement.
    They concluded that present and prospective progress in
implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this
statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to
foster the stability of exchange rates.

<title>GERMAN BANKERS' REMARKS REVIVE TALK OF RATE CUT</title>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </dateline>Remarks by two leading central bankers
sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in
the West German three pct discount rate may be under
discussion, currency dealers said.
    Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that
monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows
required cuts in interest rates.
    Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter
Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below
its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was
not making a forecast on interest rates, however.
    Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar
gained slight background support from the speculation.
    But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80
pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money
market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either
offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate
and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.
    It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less
than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact
expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could
move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.
    Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative
capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of
whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.
    ""In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
mounting economic activity.""
    Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the
generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the
first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a
counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

<title>SOVIET TRADE DEFICIT WITH WEST SOARS IN 1986</title>
<dateline>    MOSCOW, April 9 - </dateline>The Soviet trade deficit with the West
almost quadrupled last year, reaching 2.72 billion roubles
compared with 713 mln in 1985, official figures showed.
    Statistics published by the monthly journal Foreign Trade
showed Soviet trade turnover for 1986 fell to 130.9 billion

    Moscow's trade surplus with East Bloc countries continued

to the world oil price slump, which hit Moscow's main export

said the predicted rise in industrial production in the U.S.
And Europe should boost its 1987 performance.
    Consumption of some base metals and their dlr prices are
showing signs of improvement, although iron ore markets have
weakened. The oil price in U.S. Dlrs is above the 1986 average,

profits lower at 245 mln stg after 257 mln the previous year.
Pretax profits also dipped to 601.7 mln stg after 614.4 mln.
    RTZ said the excellent performance of its expanding range
of industrial businesses in 1986 was offset by the collapse in
oil prices.
    Industrial businesses contributed 202 mln stg to net
profit, a 40 pct increase from 144 mln in 1985, and 60 pct of
the total. Trading performance improved at wholly-owned

<title>EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN MARKING NO CHANGE IN POLICY</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, April 9 - </dateline>The maximum export rebate granted at
yesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy over
producer complaints that they are not obtaining the EC
intervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, EC
Commission sources said.
    The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for
118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous
week, but the change is explained by world market conditions.
    Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to
obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one
Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week,
the sources said.
    They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had
to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from
operators protesting that rebates are too low.
    Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar.
But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless

<title>PHILIPPINE TELEPHONE FIRM PLANS STOCK SPLIT</title>
<author>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    MANILA, April 9 - </dateline>The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co
&lt;PLDT.MN&gt; is planning a two-for-one stock split and a 20 pct
stock dividend later this year to reduce excess market
buoyancy, Vice-President Sennen Lazo told Reuters.
    Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the
company's common stock from 10 to five pesos.
    He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18
mln common shares of stock on the record date of September 15
1987. ""The exercise should make our stock more marketable,"" Lazo
said. ""Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors.""
    PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February
1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the Manila
Stock Exchange.
    Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15,
would also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15.
    PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68
pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six
billion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985.
    At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders.
    A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely to
be substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to
three pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax
from which it was previously exempt.
    The government has not so far ordered the implementation of
the tax decision.
    PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the
Philippines. On December 31 1986 the company had 856,014
telephones in operation, representing 94 pct of all instruments
in the country.

reported a parent company net profit up 34.8 pct to 140.1 mln
francs from 103.9 mln francs a few weeks before its
denationalisation around the end of this month.
    Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest in
terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,

planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer
ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to
the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad.
    Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it was
nationalised by the Socialists in 1982.
    The sources said it was too early to give details of the
planned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a
likely date for the flotation launch.
    So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33
mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to
large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to
ten shareholders before the flotation.
    The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mln
franc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday.
""The privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients,""
CCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre told Reuters.
    Market sources put the total value of CCF's privatisation
at between four and five billion francs.
    De la Serre said the bank was likely to attract at least
the same number of investors as &lt;Sogenal&gt;, another recently
privatised bank in which 850,000 people bought shares.
    The government's sweeping privatisation programme has also

Nationale Nederlanden NV &lt;NTTN.AS&gt; (NatNed) said it expected at
least unchanged results in 1987 after reporting 1986 net
profits up 5.3 pct to 635.5 mln guilders from 603.4 mln in
1985,
    Revenues increased by 0.5 pct to 17.35 billion guilders
after 17.27 billion the previous year, and the dividend was
raised to 2.50 guilders per share from 2.38 guilders in 1985,
corrected on a capital increase.
    The company said guilder revenue and profit were pressured
by falls in exchange rates, particularly in the US and
Australian dollar and sterling.
    Without these currency fluctuations, net profit would have
been 30.7 mln guilders higher and revenue 1.97 billion higher,
NatNed said.
    The international share in turnover was 50 pct in 1986
compared with 52 pct in 1985.
    The company's life insurance result fell to 365.7 mln
guilders after 428.4 mln in 1985 due to currency influences,
tighter interest margins and increased investment.
    Claim payouts fell to 9.9 mln guilders after 66.6 mln the
previous year.
    The company's total assets reached 69.87 billion guilders
in 1986 against 67 billion the year before.
    Assets per share equalled 65.68 guilders against 65.53.
    Without these currency fluctuations, net profit would have

<title>GERMAN MONEY MARKET SPLIT ON LOWER RATE PROSPECTS</title>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </dateline>Remarks by central bankers raised some
hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase
pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a
move in the near term, money market dealers said.
    Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday
that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from
speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central
bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower
limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.
    Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the
drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment
this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.
    The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in
new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80
pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,
as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.
    But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the
pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,
and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to
3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.
    The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on
repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.
    Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more
discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than
the more public adjustment of leading rates.
    The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and
allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case
since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may
allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.
    Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the
15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.
    Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week.
This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited
with banks.
    Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5
billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.
    Holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven
days of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above the
estimated 51 billion required for all of April.

<title>EC LAUNCHES ANTI-DUMPING PROBE ON JAPANESE CHIPS</title>
<dateline>     BRUSSELS, April 9 - </dateline>The European Community launched an
investigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese
semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark
an intensification of world trade strains.
    Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington
for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it
imports into the U.S.
    The EC Executive Commission said today the European
Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that
Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable
programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.
    Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM
market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been
forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in
order to compete with the Japanese.
    The Commission said it believed the Association had given
sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an
investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found
the complaints were justified.
    The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S.
And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privileged
access to the Japanese market.

<title>FINANCE MINISTERS AGREE ON NEED FOR STABILITY</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </dateline>Finance ministers from seven major
industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize
currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to
reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth.
    In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the
U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the
value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct
now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to
boost their economy.
    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it
a ""good meeting"" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters
other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome.
    Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign
exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened
again to prevent the yen rising too quickly.
    The communique said, ""The ministers and governors reaffirmed
the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent
Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will
be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances.""
    It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the
communique termed ""extraordinary and urgent measures"" including
an ""unprecedented front-end loading of public works
expenditures.""
    The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought
together ministers and central bank governors of the seven
major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
    The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment
on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris
when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the
then-current levels.
    In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall
against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by
the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at
around postwar lows.
    Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United
States and European countries for its only modest efforts to
open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its
exports.
    The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open
domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not
elaborate.
    It said the officials ""reaffirmed the view that around
current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.""

<title>AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS</title>
<dateline>    THE HAGUE, April 9 - </dateline>Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS&gt;
reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln
guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits
for 1987.
    Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion
guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its
revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a
change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would
have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.
    Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly
due to its life insurance business.
    Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose
despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and
higher personal risks.
    Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage
insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.
    In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and
life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change
in accounting for U.S. Annuities.
    AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal
investment influences that it should be accounted differently
from the more traditional insurances.
    This change in accounting practice and another change to
account for profits made on fixed interest investments,
resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln
guilders.
    AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits
were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial
costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The
Hague.
    In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged
in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial
costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.
    Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in
May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these
costs and made only a small contribution to the group's
profits.
    AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill
for Monumental Corp.
    AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December
1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.

<title>G-7 ISSUES STATEMENT AFTER MEETING</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </dateline>Following is the text of a statement
by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting
yesterday.
    1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of
seven major industrial countries met today.
    They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of
their heads of state or government.
    The managing director of the International Monetary Fund
also participated in the meeting.
    2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to
the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,
and noted the progress achieved in implementing the
undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.
    They agreed, however, that further actions will be
essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.
    In this connection they welcomed the proposals just
announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan
for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's
economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
    The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further
open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.
    3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that
around current levels their currencies are within ranges
broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic
policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.
    In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation
of the Louvre Agreement.
    They concluded that present and prospective progress in
implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this
statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to
foster the stability of exchange rates.

<title>G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </dateline>Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed
their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the
market of their resolve.
    At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa
said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a
totally new statement was needed.
    The speculative selling did not reflect economic
fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a
reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he
said.
    He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had
concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the
mark, had remained stable.
    Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the
Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental.
    ""As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression
of 'current level' is rather vague idea,"" he said.
    The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the
range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.
    It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing
a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,
Miyazawa said.
    Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the
statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven
because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other
major currencies largely have been stable.
    He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has
justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other
nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short
period since the Paris agreement.
    Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese
semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7
meeting and did not affect the currency talks.
    The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing
countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative
outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago.

    Physio Technology said the resignation of Chairman James C.
Lane can constitute non-compliance with its Series A
convertible subordinated debentures due 1996 and a default
under its agreement with the Merchants Bank of Kansas City.
    It explained a declaration of non-compliance under the
debentures would create a a default under the loan agreements
requiring immediate payment of 1.8 mln dlrs of debentures and
about 450,000 dlrs outstanding under the bank credit line.
    The company said the debenture holders intend to waive the
non-compliance, but reserve the right to withdraw the waiver at
the end of any 30 day period.
    Physio Technology said it is changing its field sales force
to independent representatives and dealers from employees to
""significantly reduce its fixed overhead.""
    Its statement did not indicate how many employees would be
affected by the move.
    The company said Lane will become an independent dealter
for the company in certain midwestern states. He will continue

<title>LONDON FREIGHT MARKET FEATURES GRAIN OUT OF U.S.</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 9 - </dateline>Moderately active grain fixing was
reported out of the U.S. But none of the business involved the
significant voyages to the Continent or Japan, ship brokers
said.
    A steady 13.50 dlrs was paid from the U.S. Gulf to Morocco
and 23.25 dlrs was paid for 27,000 long tons from the Gulf to
Taiwan. A vessel carrying 13,500 long tons of bagged wheat
flour from the Gulf to Aqaba received a lump sum of 472,500
dlrs.
    Grain from the Great Lakes to Algeria made 28 dlrs against
27.75 paid for similar fixing towards the end of March.
    Market talk suggested a Federal Commerce vessel had been
booked to move grain from the Great Lakes to Morocco on Comanav
account at about 22 dlrs and 15.50 had been paid for a cargo of
oilseeds from British Columbia to Japan, but no confirmation
was obtainable.
    On the Continent, shippers agreed 19 dlrs for wheat from La
Pallice to Buenaventura and 10.75 dlrs for grain from Ghent to
Naples/Venice range. Elsewhere, maize from East London to Japan
paid 22 dlrs.
    Soviet charterers reappeared in the timecharter sector and

<title>BUNDESBANK SEES NO CHANGE IN MONETARY COURSE</title>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </dateline>The Bundesbank sees no current reason
to change monetary course, vice-president Helmut Schlesinger
told Reuters in a telephone interview.
    Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealers
said, revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
may once again be under discussion.
    Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his
two central bank council colleagues.
    But he added that the last central bank council meeting on
April 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of
""subdued optimism,"" particularly influenced by the news brought
by several state central bank presidents.
    ""Much is going better than the impression gained by the
public from the January figures, which have been in the
meantime superseded,"" he said.
    German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a
decline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9
pct after they had been unchanged in December.
    Bank economists said that the two together showed the
economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter
of 1987.
    Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, a
steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark
rate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto
Poehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMF
meeting.
    Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates
on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase
tender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, ""Since the central
bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14
days, this is hardly probable.""
    Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved
away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of
targetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have no
comment on the subject while negotiations were still in
progress in Washington.

<title>SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES</title>
<dateline>    MADRID, April 9 - </dateline>The head of Spain's employers'
federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried
about the government's monetary policies because high real
interest rates were hampering investment.
    He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this
year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation
target. The government's perceived need to control inflation by
keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.
    High real interest rates were attracting an influx of
speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the
government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.
    Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,
liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17
pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a
target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.
    To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money
rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from
11.8 at end-1986.
    Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to
hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,
with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new
wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.
    These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish
workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.
    He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the
state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five
pct wage ceiling.
    Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in
Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first
two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct
increase over the corresponding period last year.
    However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the
peseta to correct the imbalance.

<title>INDIA FOODGRAIN TARGET 160 MLN TONNES IN 1987/88</title>
<dateline>    NEW DELHI, April 9 - </dateline>India's national foodgrain target has
been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged
from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its
annual report for 1986/87.
    Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87
due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological
sub-divisions of the country.
    The report gave the targets for various crops with
estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,
in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains
including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).
    Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was
possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying
growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.
    The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with
greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in
fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding
total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84
respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4
mln.
   India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes
of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year
development plan ending March 31, 1990.
    Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the
1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap
of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three
years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more
than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with
good weather, the report said.
    ""The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water
(irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of
improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm
materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be
vigrously pursued,"" it said.

<dateline>    WHITE PLAINS, April 9 - </dateline>Reichhold Chemical Inc said its
board adopted a warrant dividend plan in which one preferred
stock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on each
common share outstanding.
    The company said its warrant dividend plan is designed to
protect its shareholders against unsolicted, coercive attempts
to aquire control without making an adequate offer for all
shares.
    Reichhold said the adoption is not a response to any
specific takeover attempt.
    Reichhold said each right will entitle shareholders to buy
one one-hundreth of a share of a newly created series of
preferred stock at an initial exercise price of 120 dlrs, with
dividend and voting rights approximately equal to those of one
share of the company's common stock.
    The rights will be exercisable only if, without Reichhold's
prior consent, a person or group a acquires 20 pct or more of
the voting power or announces a tender offer which would result
in 20 pct ownership, the company said.
    Reichhold said it is entitled to redeem the rights at five
cts apiece before a 20 pct position has been acquired, or
before an existing 20 pct shareholder buys an additional two
pct or more of the voting power of the company, or in
connection with certain transactions afterward.
    The tax-free distribution will become effective May 1,

<title>VW SAYS 480 MLN MARKS MAXIMUM FOR CURRENCY LOSSES</title>
<dateline>    WOLFSBURG, West Germany, April 9 - </dateline>Losses for Volkswagen AG
&lt;VOWG.F&gt;, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will
not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW
spokesman said.
    The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it
would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on
1986 business, despite the provision.
    One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency
dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from
the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but
the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an ""upper limit.""
    VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board
meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in
detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign
currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing
company.
    VW has said computer programs were erased and documents
were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes
transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign
currency losses were not completed.
    VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was
arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having
evaded justice.
    Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985
profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and
parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend
an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has
also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,
which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held
dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.
    VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5
billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment
on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,
since the new capital was in preference shares.
    The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in
order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At
the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly
less than three billion marks.

<title>LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </dateline>Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of
the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest
rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.
    Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven
countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said
central banks would continue to intervene ""as and when
necessary.""
    He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more
to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.
    Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a
simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West
Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget
speech to the British Parliament.
    ""If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is
still a risk,"" he said.
    Asked if the United States should consider increasing
interest rates to support the dollar, he said, ""If there is a
need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to
be a rise in interest rates in the United States.""
    Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's
meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in
reducing its budget deficit.
    ""We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in
reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it
continue year after year,"" Lawson said.
    The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to
stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six
weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against
the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.
    Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in
the Louvre accord, he said, ""I don't think so. If there had been
no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.""
    Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson
said, ""the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode
... but one has to be vigilant.""
    He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that
""current levels"" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been
""carefully worded."" ""We know what we mean, and we all mean the
same thing,"" he said.
    Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese
measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of
weakness for that agreement.
    Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's
presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate
domestic demand.
    They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate
increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package
also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during
the second half of this year.

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </dateline>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and
have improved the prospects for a reduction in external
imbalances to more sustainable levels.
    In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim
Committee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last
night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the
Plaza agreement 18 months ago have ""now brought currencies
within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals.""
    Baker said, ""These exchange rate shifts have generally been

    As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances
""simply are not sustainable,"" Baker told the ministers.

domestic pressure"" for trade protection and was working closely
with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.
    ""While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing
what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist,"" he
said.
    Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's
executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's
compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this

continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF

<title>NATIONAL DISTILLERS &lt;DR&gt; SEES SECOND QTR GAIN</title>
<dateline>    New York, April 9 - </dateline>National Distillers and Chemical Corp
expects to realize a second quarter after-tax gain of four dlrs
per share from the 545 mln dlr sale of its spirits business to
American Brands Inc &lt;AMB&gt;.
    National Distillers' stock rose 1-1/8 to 65-1/2, after an
opening delay on the New York Stock exchange for an imbalance
of orders.
    ""I think the sales price was higher than most people
expected,"" said John Henry of E.F. Hutton Group.
    A company spokeswoman said the four dlr per share gain will
be included in second quarter net, which compares with 31 cts
per share last year, including the spirits and wine business
    ""They netted over 700 mln dlrs for spirits and wine. That
will ease their interest cost burden,"" said Henry.
    National Distillers sold its wine business last month to
Grand Metropolitan PLC's Heublein Inc for 128 mln dlrs.
    Henry said he had anticipated National Distillers would net
only 600 mln dlrs at the most from the sale of the two liquor
businesses.
    Henry said the company recovered from the sales the cost of
buying Enron Chemicals in the fourth quarter last year.
National Distillers paid 570 mln dlrs cash for Enron and
assumed 34 mln dlrs in debt. National Distillers said at the
time it bought Enron it would sell the spirits and wine
businesses, moving more into the chemical area.
    For 1986, two thirds of income were from chemicals and
propane. National Distillers earned, excluding the liquor
businesses, 2.21 dlrs per share for 1986. Income from
discontinued operations, including the liquor businesses, was
67 cts per share.

to buy up to one mln tonnes of maize into intervention stores

normally end on April 30, Commission sources said.
    They said approval was given by the EC's Cereals Management
Committee because of the possible disturbance of the market due
to heavy imports of maize under the agreement between the EC

    The agreement guarantees access to the Spanish market for
two mln tonnes of non-EC maize a year for the next four years.
    The sources said the intervention price for the maize would
be 201.49 Ecus a tonne.
    They said at this price it seemed unlikely that the full

beneficial interest of American Realty Trust at a price of 3.75

<title>EXPORTS OTHER THAN COFFEE RISE SHARPLY IN COLOMBIA</title>
<dateline>    BOGOTA, April 9 - </dateline>Colombian exports other than coffee rose
55 pct in January compared with the same period last year,
figures from the government statistics institute show.
    Non-coffee exports amounted to 180.8 mln dlrs fob compared
with 147.5 mln dlrs for coffee, a drop of 42 pct from last
year.
    The trade balance registered a 35 mln dlr surplus, compared
with a 56 mln dlr surplus in January 1986.
    The national planning department forecast that in 1987
coffee, Colombia's traditional major export, will account for
only one third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion dlrs.

quarter earnings were reduced by 875,000 dlrs by placing 53.2
mln dlrs of loans to Brazil and six mln dlrs in loans to
Ecuador on a cash basis.
    Should these loans remain on nonperforming basis for the

    Earlier it posted net income for the period of 14.7 mln
dlrs or 87 cts a share, up from 11.7 mln dlrs or 73 cts a

    Total nonperforming assets were 114.1 mln dlrs at March 31,
up from 53.4 mln dlrs at December 31 and 79 mln dlrs at March
31, 1986 the bank said.
    The provision for loan losses for the first quarter was
eight mln dlrs compared to 11 mln a year ago. Net loan charge
offs were six mln dlrs, down from 11 mln dlrs a year ago.
    The reserve for loan losses was 78.1 mln dlrs, or two pct
of outstanding loans, higher than the 56 mln dlrs of 1.65 pct
of loans outstanding at March 31, 1986.

spokesman for Porter said.
    The spokesman said the bill was introduced without any
changes from the administration's proposal sent to Congress
last month.
    That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12
cents per pound from 18 cents now. Sugar growers would be
compensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments,
to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments to
growers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.
    Representatives of sugar growers have rejected the
proposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.

<title>CANADA TRADE RISE SEEN AS START OF RECOVERY</title>
<author>    By Russell Blinch, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    OTTAWA, April 9 - </dateline>Canada's trade picture has brightened
considerably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector
would post a long awaited recovery this year.
    The federal government reported today that the monthly
surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February,
double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than
February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally.
    ""Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend,"" said Richardson
Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.
    Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the
next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the
year.
    ""We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the
year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is
indicative of that,"" commented economist James Donegan at the
Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.
    Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23
pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion
dls in the month.
    ""Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of
exports up by 5.9 pct in February,"" the agency said in its
monthly report.
    Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85
billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion
dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.
    Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end
up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal
10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion
dlrs.
    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched
off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85
U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after
closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.
    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early
afternoon trading.
    Economists have been banking on an improved trade
performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
Canadian economy.
    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched
off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85
U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after
closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.
    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early
afternoon trading.
    Economists have been banking on an improved trade
performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
Canadian economy.
    They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at
a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays
this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into
the country.
    Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United
States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be
strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer
spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.
    ""We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export
performance is income growth in the U.S.,"" said Midland's
Donegan.
    But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist
Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and
said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's
trade upturn.
    Jestin said, ""Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing
signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate
that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is
probably transitory.""

<title>CLEVITE &lt;CLEV&gt; AMENDS RIGHTS PLAN</title>
<dateline>    GLENVIEW, ILL., April 9 - </dateline>Clevite Industries Inc, which
earlier received a 96 mln dlr takeover offer from J.P.
Industries Inc &lt;JPI&gt;, said it amended its Shareholder Rights
Plan so that certain provisions of the plan cannot occur until
the board determines that it is in the best interests of the
company and stockholders.
    The plan, adopted in December 1986, permits Clevite to
issue shares at half price to existing stockholders and allows
stockholders to buy shares of an unfriendly bidder at half
price.
    Clevite said the amendments by its board effectively mean
that the so-called flip-in and flip-over provisions of its
rights plan can only be triggered by affirmative board
approval.
    The company said it acted inview of the proposed
acquisition and because certain debt restrictions could block
its ability to redeem the rights.

<title>SOVIET UNION TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 86/87-USDA</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </dateline>The U.S. Agriculture Department
increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet
Union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.
    In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the
USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because
Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last
month.
    USDA said the increased purchasing is ""somewhat surprising""
because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.
    All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,
USDA said.
    Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12
mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes
miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.
    USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered
through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.
    The severe winter ""is believed to have resulted in above
average winter-kill,"" USDA said.
    Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses
maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying
grain recently.
    USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes
grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat
and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.

<title>DISNEY FAMILY MAKES BID FOR HOLLY SUGAR &lt;HLY&gt;</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </dateline>The Roy Disney family disclosed in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it made
a bid to acquire Holly Sugar Corp for a package of cash and
securities.
    Shamrock Holdings of California Inc, a Disney family
company, said it submitted the bid on April 8 to Salomon
Brothers Inc, Holly Sugar's investment banker.
    The offer was for 45 dlrs in cash, securities with a face
value of 70 dlrs, and a ""contingent payment certificate"" that
would pay out as much as 70 dlrs over a 20-year period for each
share of Holly Sugar outstanding.
    The Disney family already holds 101,300 Holly Sugar shares
or 9.0 pct of the total outstanding following purchases of
12,500 shares March 13-April 17, Shamrock told the SEC.
    Shamrock said it had asked for certain information about
Holly Sugar's financial condition but had been turned down. It
said its offer was therefore subject to further discussions.
    ""Once we have had an opportunity to complete our due
diligence evaluation of the company, including inspections of
certain facilities and meetings with key management personnel,
we would be prepared to negotiate all aspects of our proposal,
including price,"" it said in its April 8 letter.

<title>U.S. OIL DEPENDENCY SEEN RISING TO RECORD LEVEL</title>
<dateline>    SAN FRANCISCO, April 9 - </dateline>The United States' dependency on
foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,
according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry
Research Associates.
    Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference
here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much
as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high
level of 47 pct in 1977.
    ""The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is
inevitable,"" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil
imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.
    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for
33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to
40 pct by 1990.
    ""However, the rate of this growth can be affected
positively or negatively through government action or
inaction,"" Lichtblau said.
    He said that one of the government's negative actions is
the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a
disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash
flow for oil exploration.
    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor
price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.
    ""An international floor price adopted by all or most
industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective
measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if
we imposed it alone,"" Lichtblau said.
    Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic
fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen
U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.
    A potential for alternative supplies could limit the
willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.
    Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer
tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans
for alternative energy.

<title>USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES REPORT </title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </dateline>U.S. corn sales of just over 1.0 mln
tonnes in the week ended April 2 were eight pct above the prior
week, but 25 pct below the four-week average, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, the
department said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largest
buyers.
    Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September
1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.
    Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season and
net reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were
four-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and the
four-week average, it said.
    Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination with
purchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.
    Other significant purchasers for the current year were
Mexico and Honduras, it said.
    Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below the
prior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.
    Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the major
purchasers, the department said.
    Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell
31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-week
average. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, the
Netherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset by
reductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.
    Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400
tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700
tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, the
Department said.
    Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200
bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88
season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's level
but nine pct below the four-week average.
    Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followed
by Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said.
The primary buyers for the 1987/88 season were South Korea,
Spain, Japan and Taiwan, the department said.
    Sorghum sales of 143,300 tonnes were 25 pct less than the
prior week, with Japan and Venezuela the main buyers.

<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </dateline>U.S. bank discount window borrowings
less extended credits averaged 361 mln dlrs a day in the week
to Wednesday, April 8, the Federal Reserve said.
    Total daily borrowings in the week fell 99 mln dlrs to 591
mln dlrs, with extended credits down 35 mln dlrs at 230 mln
dlrs. The week was the second half of the two-week statement
period that ended Wednesday. Net borrowings averaged 425 mln
dlrs in the first week of the period.
    Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on
April 8, the Fed said banks had average net free reserves of
447 mln dlrs.
    A Fed spokesman told a press conference that there were no
large one-day net misses in the Fed's estimates of reserves in
the week ended Wednesday.
    Of the week's borrowings, money center banks accounted for
65 pct, and small banks for almost 35 pct. On Wednesday, when
net borrowings were 1.36 billion dlrs and Fed funds averaged a
high 6.45 pct, money center banks accounted for more than 90
pct of the borrowing.
    Borrowings in the latest two weeks averaged 393 mln dlrs a
day, the highest since the statement period ended January 28.
    Float ranged from about 250 mln dlrs on Thursday to between
one and 1.25 billion dlrs on Monday and Tuesday.
    The spokesman said Monday's float included 500 mln dlrs in
holdover float at one Fed branch due to mechanical problems.
    About 500 mln dlrs of Tuesday's float reflected
non-weather-related transportation float in one Eastern Reserve
bank.
    As-of adjustments ranged from minus 500 mln dlrs on Monday,
when cash letter errors at two eastern reserve banks were
corrected, to plus 500 mln dlrs on Thursday, when a correction
was made to unposted funds at a single bank.
    In the first half of the statement period ended Wednesday,
banks held excess reserves on the first four days of the week
but ran a deficit on Wednesday.
    In the second week, they ran a deficit on Thursday, Friday
and Monday but held excess reserves on the final two days.

<title>TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS SYSTEM NEEDS STABILITY</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </dateline>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as
had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances
from emerging in the global economy.
    In remarks before the afternoon session of the
International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he
was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.
    ""But I do suggest,"" he said, ""that we need something to give
it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction
when the wind shifts.""
    He said that indicators can serve ""as a kind of compass"" but
added that structural indicators can help focus attention on
some policies.
    Baker, however, said the IMF ""needs to move beyond
macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that
can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific
relevance to the imbalances we face today.""
    The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given
a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article
IV consultations -- that the Fund performs.
    Baker also told the policy making group that it was time
for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF
surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the
public.
    ""In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF
appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of
follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF
recommendations, and greater use of special consultation
procedures,"" he said.
    Baker emphasized that indicators were a device ""for moving
beyond rhetoric to action.""
    He said they provide ""more structure to the system, and
induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of
policy coordination.""
    He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be
reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.
    ""This should be matter of priority for the executive board,""
he said.
    Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative
medium-term economic scenarios for countries that ""can help us
focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by
identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the
implications of these options.""
    He said also that further work should be done on finding
paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.
    ""If we are to take effective remedial action when there are
significant deviations from an intended course, then we must
have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for
key variables,"" he said.

<title>U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS</title>
<author>    by Keith Leighty, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, April 9 - </dateline>Commodities from gold to grains to
cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses
in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of
inflation and economic instability.
    Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New
York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a
troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.
    A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that
inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations
to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve
Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham and Co., in New York.
    The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from
the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their
commitment to support its value, and despite reports of
intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.
    Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known
as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term
direction of the currency markets.
    ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""If
they do, it's not evident.""
    ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market
take values to where they should be.
    ""One way or another, we will force our major trading
partners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correct
the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.
    ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long
time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's
going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's
happening,"" he said.
    The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities
cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.
    At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds
saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning
to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty
McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of
Dominick and Dominick.
    The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout
the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton
posted broad gains.
    Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the
grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome
supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate
export demand.
    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department
raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by
two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.
    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately
higher.
    Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said
hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at
this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field
work to market animals.

continuing operations will exceed 1986 results and recover to
1985 levels when the company earned 152 mln U.S. dlrs or 1.70

    ""We'll have a substantial increase in earnings from
continuing operations,"" he told reporters after the annual

lost ground and reach 1985 results.
    In 1986, profits from continuing operations slumped to
139.5 mln dlrs or 1.54 dlrs a share. The total excluded losses
of 30 mln dlrs on discontinued operations.
    Goodrich said Moore is still actively looking for

manufacturing or handling.
    ""We could do a large acquisition,"" he said when asked if
the company could raise as much as one billion dlrs for this

passed by shareholders to create a new class of preferred

<title>ANALYSTS DOUBT FED FIRMED DESPITE BORROWING RISE</title>
<author>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </dateline>Economists said that they doubt the
Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite
higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week
statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.
    Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged
393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln
dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were
1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.
    ""One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it
probably isn't,"" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.
    Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy
modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the
two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging
around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.
    However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest
two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand
often pushes up borrrowings.
    ""Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it
looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions
late in the statement period and didn't quite make it,"" said
Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
    A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that
the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or
more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.
    Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in
its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer
reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.
    The Fed took no market reserve management action last
Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added
temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of
customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves
directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.
    Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the
two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on
Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's
overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.
    ""It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at
this time,"" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.
    Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi
said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest
rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak
economies in the United States and abroad and add to the
financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.
    ""Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest
statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar
tumbled,"" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.
    He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new
statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's
Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed
to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.
    In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in
Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that
the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade
imbalance between the United States and Japan.
    The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for
steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average
Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where
the rate has been since early November.
    ""I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter
policy to help the dollar, as some suspect,"" said Sullivan of
Dean Witter.
    If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just
nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from
six to 6.10 pct previously.

<title>U.S. MARKETS OFFER GLIMPSE OF VOLCKER NIGHTMARE</title>
<author>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </dateline>Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financial
markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's
wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that
is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.
    For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline
as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell
sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.
    But that confidence is now cracking as the financial
markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's
often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.
    ""Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar
freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,"" said
David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.
    The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in
40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington
failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a
credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short
of further depreciation of the dollar.
    Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid
worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare
away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.
    The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12
dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike
in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down
by 33 points to 2339.
    Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the
markets' instability frightening. He believes economic
fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that ""once
you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.""
    ""There's a stark possibility that you could get a
destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates
and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.""
    Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics
in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the
controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and
264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.
    ""We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But
the agony may be fairly drawn out,"" Marris told Reuters.
    Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this
year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it
would take very little to touch off what he calls the second
phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the
dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.
    The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on
March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.
    The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with
historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are
not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its
decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.
    Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest
weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks
suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling
below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as
part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.
    Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of
confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced
plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic
imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.
    Many economists believe that long-run stability will not
return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is
addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the
massive budget deficit.
    But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of
central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no
choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.
    ""The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a
substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding
cut abroad, at least by Japan,"" said Lanston's Jones.
    Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest
rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for
American farmers, Latin American governments and others.
    But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and
Co, scoffed at the notion. ""It's ridiculous to think the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak
against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar
weakness,"" he said.
    Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being
made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.
    ""We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the
budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody
cares,"" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69
will have been greater.
    He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and
thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.
    But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that
a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. ""Put on
your helmets,"" Giordano said.

<title>JAPAN HAS NO PLANS TO CUT DISCOUNT RATE</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </dateline>Bank of Japan sources said the bank
has no plans to cut its discount rate.
    They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan
during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower
its discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feel
any need for a cut at all.
    Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters
earlier today that some countries - those with strong
currencies - might have to cut interest rates.
    The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to
call the G-7 pact a failure.
    The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's
renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by
remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the
dollar's fall had been orderly.
    They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's
comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since
the Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span,
not the currency's recent movements.
    They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize
on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or
the other.
    The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more
weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market
stability than on other currencies.
    Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers
that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would
reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the
U.S. And world economies, they said.
    In February and in March of this year, Japanese investors
reduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sources
said.
    Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy,
Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about
currency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said.
    This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a
triangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen and
dollar/European currencies.
    At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries did
not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did
not object to the yen strengthening, they said.

<title>AUSTRALIAN UNIONS AND NSW GOVERNMENT REACH DEAL</title>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, April 10 - </dateline>Union and New South Wales government
officials have reached a compromise in a dispute over workers
compensation, averting increased industrial action in the
state, union sources said.
    But some unions, including those of building and mining
workers, said they were dissatisfied with the deal and would
continue their strikes for a few more days.
    State officials said the government had agreed to revise
its proposals to cut compensation and would allow slightly
higher cash benefits for injured workers.
    Under the original proposal, which sparked strikes and
other industrial action in the state on April 7, workers'
compensation would have been cut by one third. Full details of
the compromise package are not yet known.
    The Labour Council, affiliated to the Australian Council of
Trade Unions (ACTU), had threatened to paralyse New South Wales
unless the government modified its pending legislation on the
issue.
    State officials said the only sectors affected in the past
three days were some government building projects, railway
freight movement and cargo handling in Sydney's ports.

<title>JAPAN WARNS U.S. IT MAY RETALIATE IN TRADE DISPUTE</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 11 - </dateline>Japan warned the United States it may
take retaliatory measures if the United States imposes its
planned trade sanctions on April 17, a senior government
official said.
    Shinji Fukukawa, Vice Minister of the International Trade

measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and
other actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs on
some Japanese exports as planned next week.
    However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade
talks with the United States despite its failure to convince
America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of
emergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday.
    Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions in
retaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honour a July
1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets
outside the United States and to open its home market to
American goods.
    Fukukawa said the United States had regrettably not

<title>SMUGGLING BLAMED FOR CLOSURE OF HAITIAN SUGAR FIRM</title>
<dateline>    PORT-AU-PRINCE, April 11 - </dateline>A sugar mill which was this
nation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday,
saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from
Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic.
    The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO)
will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to
40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital,
the company said.
    ""Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO
regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane
after April 10,"" the mill warned planters earlier this week.
    Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen
months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking
oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer
prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing
hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.
    At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to
receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a
warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound
(45-kg) bags of sugar.
    ""We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar.
We have no money left to continue operations,"" Rigaud said.
    He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an
additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.
    Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier
two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.
    He said the government then began importing refined sugar
at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and
the provisional military-civilian government that replaced
Duvalier last year continued the policy.
    ""But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete
with smuggled Dominican refined sugar,"" Rigaud said.
    HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above
the usual minimum wage of three dlrs.
    It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian
supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a
minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.
    Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. ""We're dead,
and it's the government that's causing us to die,"" declared
Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.

<title>TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS</title>
<dateline>    TAIPEI, April 11 - </dateline>Taiwan announced plans for another round
of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade
talks with Washington which officials described as a move to
help balance trade with the United States.
    Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's
Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of
products included 60 items asked by Washington.
    ""The move is part of our government efforts to encourage
imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United
States,"" he said.
    He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet
that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,
apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut
by between five and 50 pct.
    The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday
and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting
on April 20, he added.
    Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700
foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its
growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's
largest trading partner.
    Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and
pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade
deficit with Taipei.
    Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6
billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It
widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78
billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.
    Today's announcement came before a departure later today of
a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of
trade talks with U.S. Officials.
    The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last
night he was leaving with ""a heavy heart,"" meaning that he would
face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist
sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus
with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.
    Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.
Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,
purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,
import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.
    ""I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from
our talks with the U.S.,"" he said without elaborating.

<title>BRITISH MINISTER SAYS HE WARNED TOKYO OF SANCTIONS</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 11 - </dateline>A British minister said he had given the
Japanese government a clear warning of sanctions against
Japanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to its
internal markets ""and it was clearly understood.""
    Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on his
return from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese were
beginning to appreciate the need to be ""fair and open"" about
access to their own markets.
    At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition
charges that his trip had been a failure because he had
returned empty-handed.
    ""I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear
message to the Japanese government, and I delivered it very
clearly, and it has been clearly understood.""
    Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the
govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions
against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in
Britain.
    ""It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing
operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries
from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing
them to carry out other kinds.""
    ""I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made it
clear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall use
them.""
    He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became
involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained
more than anyone else from an open trading relationship.
    ""I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this
relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to
be fair and open about access to their own markets.""
    On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc
&lt;CAWL.L&gt;, which is trying to win a significant share of
telecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had told
the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case.
    He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and
Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday,
he said.
    Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan,
but would have to coordinate action with its European Community
partners.
    Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials
yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a
range of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States
markets if Washington imposes trade sanctions against Tokyo as
it has threatened.

<title>DRY SPELL IN PHILIPPINES DAMAGES AGRICULTURE CROPS</title>
<dateline>    MANILA, April 11 - </dateline>A prolonged dry spell has damaged
111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces
in the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officials
said.
    They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce
estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of
rainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing
conditions continued until next month.
    Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the
losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in
other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry
spell.
    Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),
representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8
mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.
    About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at
170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.
    Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been
hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total
thus the damage is considered negligible.
    In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by
production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified
into the cash crop from sugar two years ago.
     The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production
in the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to
320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were no
reports of actual damage.

<title>TEXACO SEES BUSINESS LITTLE HIT BY BANKRUPTCY MOVE</title>
<author>    By Julie Vorman, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, April 13 - </dateline>Texaco Inc &lt;TX&gt; said its decision to
file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
code will not affect the majority of its businesses.
    It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its
32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property,
plant and equipment, were free of the action.
    Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating
subsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are
affected, it said.
    But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents
per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments
on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.
    Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were
demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a
result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL&gt;.
    Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond
of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985
judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's
1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp &lt;GTY&gt;. The bond almost
matches the damages awarded against Texaco.
    Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin
to attach its assets to secure the judgment.
    Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut
Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to
the Texas courts.
    Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all
Texaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of
the Pennzoil lawsuit.
    ""Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond
issue and the larger dispute failed,"" James Kinnear, Texaco's
president and chief executive officer, told reporters.
    Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on
Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until
the end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.
    Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash
bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of
earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not
sell any assets, Kinnear said.
    Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of
credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under
11.1 billion dlrs, he added.
    Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the
company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on
Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for
bankruptcy.
    He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a
confidentiality agreement between the two companies. ""Texaco
told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go
to bankruptcy court,"" Jamail said.
    Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would
prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were
ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.

<title>YUGOSLAV ECONOMY WORSENED IN 1986, BANK DATA SHOWS</title>
<dateline>    BELGRADE, April 13 - </dateline>National Bank economic data for 1986
shows that Yugoslavia's trade deficit grew, the inflation rate
rose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded and
the value of the dinar fell.
    The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pct
higher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first three
months of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hard
currency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.
    Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures in
dinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollars
based on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.
    Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with the
convertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344
mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to a
deterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currency
area rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.
    Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 while
industrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank's data
showed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.
    Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.
    Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wages
were too high given the level of productivity.
    Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of the
last quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.
    Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 money
supply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9
billion dinars. Yugoslavs have 9.8 billion dlrs worth of
foreign currency savings in the country and 20 billion dlrs
abroad, mostly owned by workers employed in western Europe.
    The dinar fell by 73.1 pct against a basket of hard
currencies in 1986. The highest depreciation was against the
Swiss franc, 85.3 pct, and the lowest against the U.S. Dollar,
46.2 pct.

<title>ANZ BANK SETS ONE-FOR-TWO BONUS ISSUE</title>
<dateline>    MELBOURNE, April 13 - </dateline>Australia and New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S&gt; said it will make a one-for-two bonus issue
from its asset revaluation reserve to shareholders registered
June 2.
    The proposed bonus and an increase in authorised capital to
one billion one-dlr par shares from 600 mln will be put to
shareholders for approval at an extraordinary general meeting
on May 26, the ANZ said in a statement.
    The issue will absorb about 230 mln dlrs of the 260.9 mln
standing in the asset revaluation reserve, it said.
    The bank said that by lowering the dividend rate it expects
to maintain the value of dividend payout on the enlarged
capital at about the level of its last full year ended
September 30. The group paid 31 cents a share and 133.1 mln
dlrs in all for that year.
    Shareholders will also be asked to approve changes in the
bank's articles of association to allow it to offer shares in
lieu of the interim dividend at a discount of five pct to the
market price.
    The group is the latest to announce a tax-free bonus issue

<title>OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS</title>
<author>    By Larry Welsh, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 12 - </dateline>A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome
Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO&gt; by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO&gt;
may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door
for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
    Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
substantial payments to creditors will expire.
    Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
    Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
negotiations.
    TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt
restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
Ltd said from Toronto.
    Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
    ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""
said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
Calgary.
    TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
refinancing packages, Gobert said.
    The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
to agree to a restructuring, he added.
    ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.
    Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to
us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
reluctant to come forward,"" he said.
    Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
    Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
TransCanada's.
    Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
    However, he said not enough financial details are known
about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
TransCanada's proposed offer.

<title>TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN</title>
<author>    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, April 13 - </dateline>Member states of the European
Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which
they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open
its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.
    Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC
countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the
willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese
government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.
    However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as
EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.
    Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to
an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could
raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.
Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.
    The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations
entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed
to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of
the U.S.
    The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's
trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in
March, up from 1.94 billion in February.
    In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion
dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one
pct to 12.43 billion dlrs.
    In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has
decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.
    Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen
Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application
of French quality standards -- something EC states say often
happens to their own exports entering Japan.
    Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese
banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,
because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in
competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.
    However, British officials in London have said that the
government may have gone too far in implying that it would take
immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.
    By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful
economy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring
to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own
industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.
    The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent
years, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open
its market with specific demands for moves in key areas.
    At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end
allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and
spirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts
for the building of a new international airport, and to
simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.
    EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but
often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff
barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.
    They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the
EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.
    One of the problems Britain could face if it were to
withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers
would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,
they point out.

significantly up on last year in all divisions.
    It said there were good opportunities for growth in both
existing and recently acquired businesses as well as for growth
by acquisition in related areas.

to 24.8 mln stg for the year to December 28. Turnover rose to
242.1 mln from 211.5 mln.
    Most of its companies performed well despite a slowdown in
the U.S., U.K. And Australian economies in the first half.
    Currency fluctuations reduced pretax profit by around one
mln stg, it noted.
    Morgan said although profits in the electronics sector
improved to 1.0 mln stg from 100,000 stg previously, results
were nonetheless disappointing.
    Sales were lower than expected, due mainly to delayed
defence orders and cancellations. However, it said it had taken

<title>AWB CHAIRMAN URGES FARMERS NOT TO CUT PLANTINGS</title>
<dateline>    MELBOURNE, April 13 - </dateline>Australia could lose valuable wheat
markets through lack of availability if plantings for the
coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian
Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.
    ""If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove
true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its
valuable markets,"" he said in a statement.
    Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB
spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that
farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut
back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.
    However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be
cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were
facing enormous financial pressures.
    He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln
hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about
16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting
intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.
    If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in
plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed
with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling
wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.
    ""Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat
understand a decrease in production due to drought but they
will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to
decrease production,"" Condon said.
    ""If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export
income earner, governments and government authorities will need
to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing
viability of the wheat industry,"" he added.
    Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt,
Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan.

<title>BORG-WARNER AGREES TO BUYOUT BY MERRILL LYNCH FIRM</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </dateline>Borg-Warner &lt;BOR&gt; Corp, facing an
unwanted offer from GAF Corp &lt;GAF&gt;, agreed to a 4.23 billion
dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by &lt;Merrill Lynch
Capital Partners Inc&gt;.
    Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a
definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the
new company, &lt;AV Holdings Corp&gt;, will begin a 48.50 dlr per
share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of
Borg-Warner common stock.
    The offer will be followed by a merger in which each
remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and
54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated
discount debentures.
    As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said
members of management do not plan to participate in the
transaction, but they will retain their positions with the
company.
    A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds
19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares.
    GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.
    Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to
sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo
security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
    Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for
about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed
a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the
stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup
values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and
speculated an offer would have to be sweetened.
    In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the
Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their
shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its
advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.
    James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,
said, ""We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction
with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the
employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its
strong presence in the Chicago community.""
    Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer,
which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject
to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing
arrangements.
    The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or
51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.
    Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to
provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in
subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.
    Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with
commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the
financing required to complete the transaction.
    The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in
the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying
cash interest after five years.
    The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option
for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at
102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.
    The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity
of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in
the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before
maturity.
    Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50
dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per
share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first
convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock.
    The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its
poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right,
effective immediately.

<title>TAKEOVER BATTLE FOR DOME PETROLEUM BEGINS</title>
<author>    By Solange De Santis, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TORONTO, April 13 - </dateline>A takeover battle began today for
debt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO&gt; as TransCanada
PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO&gt; announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and
Dome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.
    Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential
buyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A&gt; which is 70
pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON.N&gt;, &lt;PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd&gt;
which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd
&lt;CP.N&gt; and British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L&gt;.
    Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another
proposal from ""a substantial company"" and discussions with a
third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a
statement.
    The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,
but did not identify the companies involved in talks.
    TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline
operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common
and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which
would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer
is to Dome management, not to shareholders.
    Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,
totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.
It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.
    Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement ""violated
the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered
into with prospective purchasers"" and was apparently timed to
prevent Dome from considering other proposals.
    It said the TransCanada bid ""seems to require favourable and
substantial taxation concessions from the federal and
provincial governments."" But Dome added that its management and
financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.
    TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he
was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied
that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. ""I find (Dome's
statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to
authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce
it,"" he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the
other bidders, or the terms of other offers.
    Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at
5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.

<title>BANK OF JAPAN TO SELL 800 BILLION YEN IN BILLS</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 13 - </dateline>The Bank of Japan will sell 800 billion
yen in deficit financing bills today through 51-day repurchase
agreements maturing June 3 to help absorb a projected money
market surplus, money traders said.
    The operation will raise the outstanding supply of the
bills to a record 4,800 billion yen.
    The yield on the bills for sale to banks and securities
houses from money houses will be 3.8999 pct compared with the
two-month commercial bill discount rate today of 3.8750 pct and
the two-month certificate of deposit rate of 4.13/00 pct.
    The traders estimated the surplus today at about 1,800
billion yen.
    They said it is mainly due to 1,300 billion yen of
government tax allocations to local governments and public
entities and to excessive banking system cash holdings due to
continuous large central bank dollar purchases.

<title>CURRENCY MOVES MAY BE HURTING WORLD TRADE</title>
<author>    By Eric Hall, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 13 - </dateline>Japanese trade figures are seriously
challenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Group
of Seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates
are the key to smoothing world trade problems.
    Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo say
they are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currencies
are the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japan
shrinking?
    What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down
made world trade problems worse rather than solving them,
fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast of
world trade recession?
    U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar
fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five
pact in New York.
    The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pct
more competitive in Japan. The officials, most of them
economists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.
    Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan rising
rapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined
only 11 pct against the yen.?
    Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely
interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar
must go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct?
    At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials can
only offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.
    ""I don't know and I don't think anyone knows,"" said Hugh
Richardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.
    ""What I do know is that Community exporters are making a
hell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, there
is money to be made in Japan,"" he added.
    But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S.
Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive trade
practices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such as
agriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonable
checking and customs procedures for car imports.
    Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the
face of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, they
blame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.
    ""We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,""
said a senior official, who declined to be named. ""We like to
refrain from accusing them of not making enough effort.""
    Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of the
Keidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Morita
repeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to
understand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree. ""The real
issue is the inability of major sectors of American and
European industry to compete not only internationally but even
in their home markets,"" Peter Huggler, President of Interallianz
Bank Zurich, told a recent conference in Switzerland.

    It said under the plan, shareholdrs of record as of April
21 will receive a right to purchase under certain circumstances
at a price of 42 dlrs 0.01 preferred share for each common
share held.  The rights will expire April Nine.
    The company said the rights would be exercisable 20
business days after a party were to acquire 20 pct or more of
Crazy Eddie common stock or announce a tender or exchange offer
that would result in ownership of 30 pct or more.
    Crazy Eddie said if a party owning 20 pct or more of its

pct or more of Crazy Eddie stock, right holders other than the
acquiring party would be entitled to acquire common shares or
other securities or assets with a market value equal to twice

    If after a party acquired 20 pct or more of its stock Crazy
Eddie were acquired or 50 pct of its earnings power or assets
sold, rightholders other than the acquirer would be entitled to
buy shares of the acquirer's common stock worth twice the

make a pledge at the coming economic summit in Venice to cut

    ""I think at the summit meeting in Venice what we ought to be
trying to do is to get the other major industrial nations that
are involved to bring interest rates down, say, one pct,""
Bentsen told NBC Television's ""Meet the Press.""
    Bentsen said coordinated rate cuts could take ""billions off
the debt service of the Latin countries"" and help ease
protectionist pressures in the industrial countries.
    Bentsen also South Korea and Taiwan should be pressured to
revalue their currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar.
    ""You take the Taiwanese, with an enormous capital surplus,
enormous trade surplus, and we've had very little cooperation
there,"" he said.

same television network he agreed that the U.S. dollar had not
fallen enough against the currencies of some countries.
    ""I think that more does have to be done there in
negotiations with the countries involved, the so-called NICs

<title>OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS</title>
<author>    By Larry Welsh, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </dateline>A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome
Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO&gt; by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO&gt;
may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door
for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
    Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
substantial payments to creditors will expire.
    Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
    Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
negotiations.
    TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt
restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
Ltd said from Toronto.
    Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
    ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""
said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
Calgary.
    TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
refinancing packages, Gobert said.
    The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
to agree to a restructuring, he added.
    ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.
    Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to
us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
reluctant to come forward,"" he said.
    Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
    Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
TransCanada's.
    Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
    However, he said not enough financial details are known
about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
TransCanada's proposed offer.

<title>SOSNOFF RAISES BID FOR CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW&gt;</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </dateline>Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said he has
raised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs each
from 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seeking
to 29.1 mln from all those not already owned.
    In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by his
MTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the proration
period will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer had
been scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said he
had received a ""negligible"" number of shares in response to the
offer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate.
    Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln
common shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a
primary basis.
    Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan
as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders
would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject
to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in
June.
    The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln
dlrs in debt to finance the payout.
    Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the
amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to
give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on
the arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New
Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities.
    He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all
of Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a
merger transaction.
    Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares
he is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,
would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis.
    He said he still has received only a ""negligible"" number of
shares in response to his tender.
    In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in
the statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April
8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to
increase the price of his offer.
    Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in
place.
    Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ&gt; has now delivered
to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing
dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding
Corp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition.
    He said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM&gt;, which leads a
syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr
margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for
further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to
an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the
purchase of shares under the offer.
    Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,
each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,
or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into
Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an
independent investment baking firm.
    He said ""To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares
are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a
combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value
of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars.""
    Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to
Caesars' recapitalization.

<title>TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, April 13 - </dateline>Member states of the European
Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which
they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open
its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.
    Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC
countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the
willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese
government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.
    However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as
EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.
   Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to
an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could
raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.
Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.
    The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations
entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed
to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of
the U.S.
    The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's
trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in
March, up from 1.94 billion in February.

<title>EC COULD DECIDE ON JAPAN TRADE MOVES IN LATE MAY</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, April 13 - </dateline>The European Community (EC) has
effectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its
market to imports before it decides on possible tough
retaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.
    They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26
to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.
    The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of
member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC
pledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are
""adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market.""
    Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing
stiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese
exports.
    The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be
discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers
on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare
proposals for possible retaliatory action.
    They said the commission has powers to take some limited
action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese
exports of electrical, photographic and other goods being
diverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves.
    In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to
prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a
result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges
them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.
    Japan's trade surplus with the Community has grown
steadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March.

<title>GERMAN INSTITUTES WARN ON MONEY SUPPLY</title>
<dateline>    BONN, April 13 - </dateline>Four of West Germany's five leading
economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary
growth threatened a resurgence of inflation.
    But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,
echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said
the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not
necessarily threaten stability.
    The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which
three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in
GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.
    The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in
view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has
shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price
rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.
    Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may
seem exaggerated, they said.
    ""But it has often turned out in the past that the price
climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into
a restrictive policy,"" they said.
    The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are
less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.
    The four institutes disputed the view that monetary
expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic
investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market
investments following lower interest rates.
    ""Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of
central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a
smaller expansion of money supply,"" they said.
    A return to growth and stability did not require
spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with
open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid
an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.
    The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be
focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of
uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic
weakness other factors should be taken into account.
    Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts
and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation
speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat
in itself to price stability.
    The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth
reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the
falling mark.

<dateline>   WASHINGTON, April 13 - </dateline>The U.S. Agriculture Department has

winter and hard red spring wheat at a number of locations, a
senior USDA official said.
    USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at Kansas
City and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32
cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputy
administrator of commodity operations at the Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, said.
    The department also lowered the terminal price of hard red
spring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said.
    In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hard
red spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not to
be identified said.
    The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago,
Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as at
Pacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis.
    The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and roll
activity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided upon
last week and will be effective today, he said.
    Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiums
on high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheat
prices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a protein
premium would remain unchanged.

stock repurchase program and an exchange of debt securities for
common stock.
    The plan, along with a proposal to change its name to
Cooper Cos Inc, will be submitted for shareholders' approval at
the company's annual meeting on June 22.
    The meeting had been postponed from its original date of

options, it said.
    In addition, Coopervision said operating income in its
current fiscal quarter ending April 30 is expected to show an

its year ago quarter.
    Income from continuing operations was not immediately

    At a Drexel Burnham Lambert Investor Conference,
Coopervision chairman Parker Montgomery said, as previously

shareholders.
    He also said Coopervision's stock fell in 1986 due to its

dlrs a share, and Ivan Boesky's subsequent sale of his
position.

his position and has never recovered,"" Montgomery said. The
company's stock is currently trading at 19-1/4.
    Montgomery further told the conference, ""Don't be an

a substantial capital gain from the sale of part of its
holdings in Reebok International Limited, which will cut its
stake in Reebok to 32.2 pct from 36.7 pct.
     It said Reebok filed a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the offering of six mln
shares of Reebok common. Reebok will sell three mln shares and
Pentland will sell 1,404,866 shares, reducing its stake in
Reebok to 18.1 mln from 19.5 mln shares.
    After the offering, Reebok will have 56.1 mln shares shares
outstanding.
    Pentland said the amount of the capital gain from the sale
depends on the offering price for the Reebok shares to be
negotiated between it, Reebok, and the other selling
stockholders who will offer about 1.6 mln shares of Reebok
common, and the underwriters.
    Pentland said proceeds from the offering will be used by
Reebok to retire bank debt incurred in its acquisition of AVIA
Group for about 180 mln dlrs. Is said that afterwards, Reebok
will have bank credit lines available for general corporate
purposes, including possible acquisitions.
    Reebok's stock was selling at 45-1/2, up 1/8. At that
price, the 1.4 mln Reebok shares Pentland will sell are worth
about 64 mln dlrs and the three mln shares Reebok will sell are
worth about 136.5 mln dlrs.
    Pentland said it will use proceeds to fund growth and
possible acquisitions.
    Pentland said 4,500,000 shares of Rebbok will be offered in
the U.S. by a syndicate led by Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc and
1,500,000 shares will be offered outside the U.S. by an
international syndicate led by Kidder.
    It said the U.S. underwriters have been granted an option
to buy from certain selling stockholders up to an additional
900,000 shares to cover overallotments. Pentland said it has
not chosen to participate in this over allotment.
    Pentland said that as soon as the date and price of the
offering have been determined it will release further details.

entered a definitive purchase agreement for the sale to Dillard
of the Joske's and the Cain-Sloan divisions of Allied for 255
mln dlrs cash, subject to certain closing adjustments.
    The sale excludes certain real estate assets of Joske's and
Cain-Sloan, which Allied estimates have an aggregate value of
30 mln dlrs based on current market conditions.
    Joske's has 26 stores in Texas and one in Arizona.
Cain-Sloan has four stores in Nashville. Joske's is the largest
unit Allied has slated for sale in its restructuring.
    Allied Stores Corp, a subsidiary of Campeau Corp, was
acquired by acquired by the Canadian developer last year.
    Robert Campeau, chairman of Allied, said ""this is a
terrific start to our disposition program which is proceeding
well ahead of schedule. This sale will fulfill the requirements
under our bank agreements to sell certain assets by June 30 and
give us additional flexibility in the disposal of the remaining
divisions being sold.""
     Allied Stores is required to pay 200 mln dlrs in bank debt
by June 30. There had been some doubts on Wall Street that the
company could meet the payment.
    A Campeau source said, ""We believe this cash sale puts us
in a very strong negotiating position to maximize the proceeds
Allied can receive from its other divisions.""
    ""Allied was able to put itself in a position where it knows
it will be able to meet the June 30 payment schedules,"" the
source said.
    About 1.1 bilion dlrs in Allied assets had been targeted
for sale by Dec. 31, 1988 to pay for the aquisition of Allied
by Campeau.
    Allied will be taking bids for its other divisions.
Targeted for sale are Bonwit Tellers, Garfinckel's, Dey's,
Donaldson's, Herpolsheimer's, Heer's, Miller's, Miller and

<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </dateline>Foster Wheeler Corp &lt;FWC&gt; said an
audit of its Stearns Airport Equiment Co Inc unit, revealed
""substantial discrepancies"" in Stearns accounts that may
require material adjustments to previously announce
consolidated results of the company and its subsidiaries.
    Foster said certain Stearn officers and senior management
made Stearn's operations appear more profitable than they were
by improperly recording job costs. It said Stearn's president
and controller had resigned. A Foster spokesman said he did not
know the names of the president and controller, and could not
immediately comment on the release.
    Foster said the amount involved in the ""discrepancy"" is
about 13.7 mln dlrs before taxes or about 8.2 mln dlrs net
after tax due to an ""improper recording of job costs over a
period of several years and continuing through part of the
first quarter of 1987.""
    Stearns is a unit of Foster's Conergic Corp subsidiary.
The company said the impact on its results for 1987 was not
""likely to be significant"" but the amount to be charged to
prior periods had not been determined.
    Foster reported after tax earnings of 28 mln dlrs, 26 mln
dlrs and 35.4 mln dlrs for 1986, 1985, and 1984, respectively.

of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade
talks with Washington which officials described as a move to
help balance trade with the United States.

Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of
products included 60 items asked by Washington.
    ""The move is part of our government efforts to encourage
imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United

that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,
apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut

    The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday
and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting
on April 20, he added.
    Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700
foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its
growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's
largest trading partner.
    Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and
pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade
deficit with Taipei.
    Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6
billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It
widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78
billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.
    Today's announcement came before a departure later today of
a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of
trade talks with U.S. Officials.
    The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last
night he was leaving with ""a heavy heart,"" meaning that he would
face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist
sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus
with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.
    Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.
Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,
purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,
import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.
    ""I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from
our talks with the U.S.,"" he said without elaborating.

<title>BULGARIA, ROMANIA GRAIN CROP SEEN LESS FAVORABLE</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 13 - </dateline>Current prospects for this year's
grain crop in Bulgaria and Romania appear less favorable than
in 1986, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Belgrade
said in a field report.
    The report said the assessment was based on travel in the
two countries from March 30 to April 4.
    It said crop conditions were better than earlier expected
following the extreme dry conditions last fall and the
prolonged winter temperatures this spring.
    However, in general plant development was at least three
weeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions varied
greatly by regions, the report said.
    Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, and
especially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about
65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in good
condition, with little evidence of winterkill, while others
varied considerably, the report said.
    Fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak and
uneven stands. Spotty germination and winterkill in those
fields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said.

<title>CHEMICAL &lt;CHL&gt; NET HURT BY BRAZIL, EXPENSES</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </dateline>Chemical New York Corp said its
first-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed
1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual.
    Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln
dlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring the
Brazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs in
lost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.
    A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs
from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was
mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in
consumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.
    Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,
Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or
4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
medium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not
resumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for the
whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.
    Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on
non-accrual because the Quito government also suspended
interest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest
income by 1.5 mln dlrs.
    Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs
from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from
3.96 pct.
    This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, a
reduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation
of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and
a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's
cost of funds.
    Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from
27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrs
from 26.2 mln.
    Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5
mln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier, Chemical said.
    The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, compared
with 83.8 mln. Net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln, up from 60.7
mln, leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs at
quarter's end, or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding, compared with
594.3 mln, or 1.50 pct, a year earlier.
    Non-accruing loans at the end of March were 2.39 billion
dlrs (1.35 billion excluding Brazil), compared with 1.35
billion at the end of 1986 and 1.22 billion at the end of
March, 1986.

<title>NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK USA 1ST-QTR NET RISES</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </dateline>National Westminster Bank USA said
higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial
increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in
first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported
a year earlier.
    The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction of
income as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual.
    Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with
91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly to
middle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But some
of these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates.
    Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0
mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losses
was 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986.
    Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the
end of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs
of loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.
    The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for
the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced
by about 4.9 mln dlrs.
    National Westminster Bank USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of National Westminster Bank PLC.

<title>TALKING POINT/IBM &lt;IBM&gt;</title>
<author>    By Lawrence Edelman, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </dateline>International Business Machines Corp
has started the year aggressively, but industry analysts said
the company still faces some tough rounds in its fight to stop
a two-year earnings slump.
    ""I am more impressed with what's happening at IBM than I
have been in a long time,"" said PaineWebber analyst Stephen
Smith.
    ""But they're not out of the woods yet,"" he added.
    At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easily
topped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from an
even dollar to 1.20 dlrs.
    Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM's
performance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a full
recovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not be
felt until later in the year.
    These include the success of IBM's new personal computer
line, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,
which will begin volume shipments in July.
    In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of its
early-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves will
emerge as the year progresses.
    Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers was
relatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook than
he has been for nearly a year.
    ""Although the worldwide economic situation remains
unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,""
Akers said, pointing to, among other things, higher
first-quarter shipments. ""We remain optimistic about the
prospects for both the industry and IBM,"" he said.
    ""Akers was most encouraging,"" said PaineWebber's Smith.
    A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframe
computer sales all contributed to the better-than-expected
first-quarter results, analysts said.
    ""Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong in
March,"" after a weak January and February, said Ulric Weil of
Washington-based Weil and Associates.
    Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly called
the Sierras, ""bailed out the whole quarter,"" Weil said, adding,
""If this continues, it augers well for the rest of the year.""

<title>IRVING BANK &lt;V&gt; 1ST-QTR NET HURT BY BRAZIL</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </dateline>Irving Bank Corp said a six pct drop
in first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely the
result of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers in
Brazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status.
    Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrs
from 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per share
dropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62.
    Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs of
Ecuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter net
income by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax.
    Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mln
dlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received on
these loans during the remainder of 1987.
    Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on the
trading of securities and higher non-interest expenses,
although these were partly offset by increased trust income,
profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securities
gains, the bank said.
    The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from
185.2 mln a year earlier. The provision for loan losses was
21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986.

    Previously, the initial monthly figure has had to be

Revlon Group Inc &lt;REV&gt; said that they have entered into a
definitive mergewr agreement where MacAndrews will acquire
Revlon at 20.10 dlrs per common share in cash.
    MacAndrews said it increased its offer to purchase all
Revlon common shares to 20.10 dlrs a share, from its April 1
offer of 18.50 dlrs a share.
    Following consummation of the offer, a unit of MacAndrews
will merge into Revlon and each remaining share will be
converted into the right to receive 20.10 dlrs per share in
cash, the companies said.
    Revlon said its board of directors unanimously approved the
merger agreement.
    MacAndrews and Revlon also said they have reached a
settlement with the plaintiff in the pending litigation
challenging acquisition of the shares by MacAnrews.
    The companies said the tender offer and withdrawal rights
will expireon Tuesday April 28, unless extended.
    MacAndrews said it will promptly file revised tender offer
material with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc is acting as dealer-manager for the offer,
the companies said.
    Revlon currently has about 42 mln shares outstanding. The
current offer price is about 782 mln dlrs, a company spokesman
said, up from the previous offer of 720 mln dlrs.
    On April 1, MacAndrews and Forbes, owned by Ronald
Perelman, offered 18.50 dlrs a share for the 63 pct of Revlon
shares he did not already own.
    Since the offer was made over a dozen shareholder lawsuits
were brought against Revlon alleging the original offer was too
low.
    But, the companies said these lawsuits have been settled in
the amended offer.

<title>CANADA STOCKS/DOME PETROLEUM LTD &lt;DMP&gt;</title>
<dateline>    TORONTO, April 13 - </dateline>Dome Petroleum Ltd shares moved higher
in the U.S. and Canada after TransCanada PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP&gt;
made a 4.3 billion Canadian dlr bid for Dome and Dome said it
is in talks with two other unidentified companies.
    Market speculation is that the other two potential bidders
are not Canadian companies and DuPont's &lt;DD&gt; Conoco and
Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC&gt; are mentioned as possibilities,
Wilf Gobert of Peters and Co Ltd said.
    Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange.
TransCanada PipeLines was down 1/4 at 15-3/4 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
    Dome was the most active stock on the Toronto exchange at
1.50 dlrs per share, up 37 cts.
    Gobert characterized the market action in Dome as ""awfully
optimistic"" but said investors are hoping for a competing offer
to the shareholders.
    TransCanada PipeLines' offer is to Dome management, not to
shareholders. However, it proposes issuing new equity in a
subsidiary that would operate Dome assets. Current Dome
shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary.

<title>GTE &lt;GTE&gt; CITES LOSS OF SPRINT</title>
<dateline>    STAMFORD, Conn, April 13 - </dateline>GTE Corp said the decline in its
first quarter net income reflects a 121 mln dlr loss from its
50 pct share ownership of U.S. Sprint's operations.
    This loss is an increase from the 60 mln dlrs loss reported
on operations GTE owned a year ago quarter and prior to
entering a joint venture with United Telecommunications &lt;UT&gt; in
July 1986. Under the joint venture, each company owns 50 pct of
Sprint.
    Earlier, the company reported net income declined to 265.0
mln dlrs from 283.0 mln dlrs in the first quarter a year ago.
    Theodore Brophy, chairman of GTE said, ""we expect US
Sprint's losses to diminish later this year as customer traffic
migrates to the new fiber-optic network for long distance
telecommunications.
    The reason for the higher losses reflect lower prices as
well as higher operating costs related, in part, to the
fraudalent use of the network.
    Operating income of its telephone operations, which account
for 91 pct of the total, rose eight pct to 736.0 mln dlrs.

about two billion dlrs in about two months.
    After the company's annual meeting, Rober Mercer,
Goodyear's chairman and chief executive officer, also said 
Goodyear expects to report a profit of more than one dlr a
share from continuing operations in the first quarter. In the
same year-ago period, Goodyear reported a loss of 64 cents a
share from continuing operations.
    Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying
Celeron and they may form a consortium to buy the unit.
    Celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almost
complete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara,
Calif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserves
would not be sold separately from the pipeline.
    Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag for
Celeron was too high, Mercer said ""There is no fire sale going
on here and we can continue to keep Celeron as a profitable
operation throughout the year.""
    Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit was
based on the new share total after Goodyear's share repurchase
last year to fend off Sir James Goldsmith's hostile takeover
bid.

<title>GAF &lt;GAF&gt; SEEN RAISING BORG-WARNER &lt;BOR&gt; BID</title>
<author>    BY PATTI DOMM, REUTERS</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </dateline>GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-Warner
Corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to
be preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.
     Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for
4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch
Capital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for
89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and
securities for the balance.
    Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.
    ""I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in
with another bid,"" said one analyst, who values the company at
51 or 52 dlrs per share.
    GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of
Borg-Warner's stock.
    ""You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up
the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have
to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking
at it - that it's worth more,"" Pershing and Co analyst Richard
Henderson said.
    Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.
    GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill
Lynch officials did not return phone calls.
    Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman
sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics
business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as
telephones, computer terminals, and appliances.
    ""Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical
operation these days,"" said Henderson.
    ""He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he
does not like to get pushed around,"" said Henderson.
    GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover
of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF
did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its
investment in Carbide.
    Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its
Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer
and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would
give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.
    ""It's a win-win situation,"" said one analyst.
    One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be
forthcoming shortly.
    ""I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this
book,"" he said.
    Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,
protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security
guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
    Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows
GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it
would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per
share.
    ""I think there's a probability he goes up in price,"" said
Rose.
    Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman
would do. ""Sam's a low-risk, high-return player.""
    ""Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical
enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,"" Rose
said.
    Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add
earnings momentum to GAF. ""I worked out that paying as much as
50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if
they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,"" said John
Henry of E.F. Hutton.
    Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986
operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion
dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net
earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.
    ""The Borg chemical business is great,"" said Rose, adding
its only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co &lt;MCT&gt; and Dow
Chemical Co &lt;DOW&gt;.

<title>U.S. BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON</title>
<author>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </dateline>Major U.S. banks may lift prime
lending rates again within days due to recent increases in
their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is
nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.
    In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most
banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to
7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own
cost of money. That spread has narrowed again.
    ""A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,""
said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.
    Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is
justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and
the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a
percentage point.
    He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage
points since last October until it fell below one point and
triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.
    ""We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon
as this week,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.
    ""We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the
near future,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
    ""Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding
costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,""
said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.
    However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime
because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan
demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain
recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.
    Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift
short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He
said ""if there is widespread belief money market rates will
stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.""
    Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a
dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar
fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders
said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.
    In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to
stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.
interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.
    Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions
on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said ""it has become
clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure
in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.""
    Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest
rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation
that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.
    That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the
market than most economists had expected.
    On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small
amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements
with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another
high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct
today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr
round of customer repurchase agreements.
    ""The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is
offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,""
said Jones of Lanston.
    ""The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the
need to defend the dollar,"" Jones said. He believes it is
merely shading policy toward restraint now, ""but to have a
major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy
overtly at some point.""
    Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by
becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within
four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.
    Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might
well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to
further aid the dollar.
    Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on
30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate
may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.
    ""The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening
policy to defend the dollar,"" said Leslie of Discount Corp. He
said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.
Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures
abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.

<dateline>    TORONTO, April 13 - </dateline>Nova, an Alberta Corp, chief executive
Robert Blair expressed hope that Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP&gt;
remains under Canadian ownership, but added that his company
plans no bid of its own for debt-troubled Dome.
    ""We've no plan to bid,"" Blair told reporters after a speech
to a business group, although he stressed that Nova and 57
pct-owned Husky Oil Ltd &lt;HYO&gt; were interested in Dome's
extensive Western Canadian energy holdings.
    ""But being interested can sometimes be different from
making a bid,"" Blair said.
    TransCanada PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP&gt; yesterday bid 4.30 billion
dlrs for Dome, but Dome said it was discontinuing talks with
TransCanada and was considering a proposal from another company
and was also talking with another possible buyer, both rumored
to be offshore.
    Asked by reporters if Dome should remain in Canadian hands,
Blair replied, ""Yes. I think that we still need to be building
as much Canadian position in this industry as we can and I
think it would be best if Dome ends up in the hands of Canadian
management.""
    He said he did not know who other possible bidders were.
    Blair said that any move to put Dome's financial house in
order ""will remove one of the general problems of attitude that
have hung over Western Canadian industry.""
    He added, however, that the energy industry still faced ""a
couple of tough, tough additional years.""
    Asked about Nova's 1987 prospects, Blair predicted that
Nova's net profit would rise this year to more than 150 mln
dlrs from last year's net profit of 100.2 mln dlrs due to
improved product prices and continued cost-cutting.

<dateline>    MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., April 13 - </dateline>Honeywell Inc said a gain of
20.1 pct in its 1987 first quarter operating earnings was the

rose to 43.7 mln dlrs or 96 cts a share from 36.4 mln dlrs or
79 cts in the same period a year ago.
    Better operating results in each of the company's three 
sectors offset higher interest costs in the first quarter due
to financing the December acquisition of Sperry Aerospace and
the sharing of the Federal Systems subsidiary pre-tax profit
with Honeywell Bull Inc, Honeywell said.

restructuring,"" chairman Edson Spencer said. ""All of our
businesses are producing better results than last year, even
though we do not see significant improvement in the external
market environment,"" he said.
    Total orders in the first quarter were up substantially,
with a sharp increase in aerospace and defense orders in
addition to those of the new Sperry Aerospace group, it said.
    Domestic industrial automation and control orders were
modestly higher than the same period in 1986, it said.
    Orders in Honeywell's home and building automation and
control business were flat in the U.S. and up in international

    International orders increased, with the greatest strength
in Europe, Honeywell said.

<title>AMERICAN CENTURY &lt;ACT&gt; RESTATES EARNINGS</title>
<dateline>    SAN ANTONIO, Tex., April 13 - </dateline>American Century Corp said it
has restated its earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1986 to provide an additional five mln dlrs to its loan loss
allowance, causing a restated year-end net loss of 14,937,000
dlrs, instead of 9,937,000 dlrs.
    The company said the change came after talks with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on the company's judgement
in considering the five mln dlrs collectible.
    In the note to its 1986 financial statement, American
Century said it considered the five mln dlrs collectible,
making its loan loss provision less than required.
    The company said in spite of the SEC decision, it still
feels its allowance for possible loan losses at June 30, 1986
was adequate and that it has considered all relevant
information to determine the collectibility of the five mln dlr
receivable.
    But, it said continued disagreement with the SEC staff
would not be in its best interest.

<title>TEXACO &lt;TX&gt; SAYS SOME OIL FLOWS RE-ESTABLISHED</title>
<author>    By SAMUEL FROMARTZ, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </dateline>Texaco Inc has re-established some key
oil supply lines following yesterday's court filing for
protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, said
Elton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations.
    ""Several companies say they are willing to start trading,""
Yates told Reuters in an interview.
    The company last week had stated that a number of domestic
and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil
shipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.
Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.
    Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC&gt; and other banks told
Texaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco
said in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB&gt; and J.P.
Morgan Co's &lt;JPM&gt; Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits
to cover transactions, it said.
    The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose
from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme
Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL&gt; over
the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.
    The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's
plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.
    ""Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they
could,"" Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court
ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting
supplies.
    ""It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an
avalanche,"" he said. ""Supplies were cut to the point where we
could not run the system at anywhere near capacity.""
    He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in
jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages
by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton
said.
    It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,
canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,
Occidental Petroleum Co &lt;OXY&gt; demanded cash for crude, and
Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC&gt; asked for special safeguards.
    The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC &lt;BP&gt; last
week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today
said, ""a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on
supplying. They had cancelled last week.""
    He declined to identify the company.
    &lt;Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.&gt;, the Venezuelan state oil
company that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also
halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.
    But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the
Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key
supply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the
Algerians, he added.
    Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter
11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines
and oil supplies that are key to the company's business.
    ""It will be business as usual for Texaco,"" said Martin
Klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer
and Traub.
    ""Creditors are a nervous bunch of people,"" he said. ""But
when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and
will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company.""
    But other officials at Texaco were not immediately
available to say whether discussions were being held with its
banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.

<title>GAF &lt;GAF&gt; SEEKS INFORMATION ON BORG-WARNER&lt;BOR&gt;</title>
<dateline>    New York, April 13 - </dateline>GAF Corp said it is exploring its
options in response to Merrill Lynch Capital Partners' 4.23
billion dlr offer for Borg-Warner Corp, and it has asked for
all information that was supplied to Merrill Lynch.
    A GAF spokesman said the company asked for the information
in order to enable GAF to fully evaluate its alternatives.
    The spokesman also confirmed that GAF did raise its bid to
48 dlrs cash from 46 dlrs per share on Friday.
    Merrill is offering 48.50 dlrs per share cash for 89 pct of
Borg-Warner, and a package of cash and securities for the
balance.
    The transaction with Merrill Lynch will take Borg-Warner
private in the form of a leveraged buyout. Merrill Lynch does
not intend to sell Borg-Warner assets, but it may be forced to
do so in financing the deal, said sources familiar with the
transaction.
     Borg-Warner has said its management is not a participant
in the transaction, but managers will retain their positions.
    The investors involved with Merrill include pension funds,
insurance companies and other institutional investors, sources
said.
    Analysts believe GAF, which owns 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner,
will raise its offer.
    That speculation drove Borg-warner stock up 1-3/8 to 49-5/8
in heavy trading. GAF closed at 49-5/8, off 3/4.

<title>ABU DHABI MARKETING SAID NOT BREACHING OPEC PACT</title>
<dateline>    ABU DHABI, April 13 - </dateline>A senior Abu Dhabi oil official said
in remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), was succeeding in marketing its
crude oil without breaching OPEC accords.
    Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi
National Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company's Petroleum Community
magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations.
""The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its

   ""The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on
adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control
production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to
stabilize the market,"" he added.
    OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln
bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.
    Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future
depended on how much discipline OPEC showed.
    Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was
ADNOC's most difficult ever but ""a practical and flexible
pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market
environment.""
    He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average
609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales
totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported.
    In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil

<title>DOME &lt;DMP&gt; BENEFITS FROM TAKEOVER SPECULATION</title>
<author>    By Solange De Santis</author>
<dateline>    Toronto, April 13 - </dateline>Shares of Dome Petroleum Ltd posted
their biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stock
markets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for the
debt-heavy company.
    Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange and
gained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto Stock
Exchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as high
as 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Dome
has normally moved by only a few cents per day.
    TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr
Canadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but
Dome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still
talking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.
    Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed
to be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday
stressed that its bid is ""a Canadian solution to the financial
difficulties of Dome Petroleum.""
    ""The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont
&lt;DD&gt;, and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC&gt;, which sold its Canadian
interest in 1975 and could be getting back in,"" said Wilf Gobert
of Peters and Co Ltd.
    David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British
Petroleum PLC &lt;BP&gt; is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite
BP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent
of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD&gt; it does not already own.
    Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said
in recent reports that Amoco Corp &lt;AN&gt; has also been in talks
with Dome.
    Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,
Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.
    Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as ""awfully
optimistic,"" given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome
shareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10
dlrs Canadian per common share.
    Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred
shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which
would own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada
would own 80 pct.
    However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the
potential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. ""The
TransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,""
he said.
    Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is ""at the
upper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome.""
    The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87
billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another
one billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to
secured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a
certain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.
    Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion
Canadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on
several years ago when oil prices were high and the company
wanted to expand.
    ""There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable
of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that
basis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,""
Gobert said.
    Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it
is a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds
reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion
cubic feet of natural gas.
    The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres
of oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the
heart of Canada's oil industry.
   Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of
land across Canada.
   The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs
Canadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of
2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be the
largest ever by a Canadian company.

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 13 - </dateline>The U.S. Treasury said its weekly
auction of three-month bills produced an average rate of 5.98
pct, with a 6.08 pct rate on six-month bills.
    These rates compared with averages of 5.53 pct for the
three- and 5.63 pct for the six-month bills sold last week.
    The bond-equivalent yield on three-month bills was 6.17
pct. Accepted bids ranges from 5.92 to 5.99 pct and 60 pct of
the bids at the high, or stopout rate, were taken. For six

pct to 6.10 pct with 48 pct of the bids accepted.
    The Treasury said it received 25.99 billion dlrs of bids
for the three-month bills, including 1.2 billion dlrs in
non-competitive bids from the public. It accepted 6.6 billion
dlrs of bids, including 2.1 billion dlrs from the Federal
Reserve and 180 mln dlrs from foreign and international
monetary authorities.
    Some 24.7 billion dlrs in bids for six-month bills were
received, including 832 mln dlrs in non-competitives. The
Treasury accepted 6.6 billion dlrs, including 1.8 billion dlrs
from the Fed and 1.2 billion dlrs from foreign and
international authorities.
    The average price for the three-month bills was 98.488 and
prices ranged from 98.504 to 98.486.  The average price for the
six-months bills was 96.926, and prices ranged from 96.977 to
96.916.
    The average yield on the three-month bills was the highest

<title>TEXACO FILING ADDS UNCERTAINTY IN OIL MARKET</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </dateline>U.S. oil traders said Texaco Inc's
filing for protection under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy code is
adding uncertainty to an already skittish oil market, but
opinions are divided on the impact to the market.
    ""The filing is holding up wet barrel trading today,"" said
one trader. ""Everyone is talking about it, assessing their
company's situations in relation to Texaco,"" he added.
     Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco are
concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies
under the bankruptcy filing.
    However, others were less worried. ""The first paid will be
the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the
shipping industry,"" one New York trader said.
    ""If Texaco doesn't get crude supplies it can't run its
refineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything,""
he added.
    Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement
with Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally
interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co.
    However, others were less worried. ""The first paid will be

    ""There is some reluctance to trade with Texaco but no great

toward prudence in their dealings with the company.
    Traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment or
letters of credit, or to continue to trade as usual with Texaco
on an open line basis, he said.
    Another trader, however, described today's activity as
business as usual, adding that traders feel more secure because
no liens can be put on Texaco's assets while it is in
bankruptcy.
    Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texaco
filing on crude futures trading although they said the exchange
might lower Texaco's position limit and require higher margins
for Texaco's trades.
    New York Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary McFadden

is proprietary information. McFadden did say, however, that as
a matter of procedure, it is possible the exchange can lower
allowable position limits or increase margin requirements for

<title>MERRILL TO GET 30 MLN DLR FEE IN BORG &lt;BOR&gt; DEAL</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 13 - </dateline>Merrill Lynch and Co Inc &lt;MER&gt;
subsidiary seeking to take over of Borg-Warner Corp said it
could realize a 30 mln dlr fee for its efforts, whether or not
the deal, which it values at 4.7 billion dlrs, succeeds.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30
mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealer
manager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed.
    But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mln
dlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another party
holding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct.
    The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in any
tender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealer
manager services or for break-up of the deal.
    Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group of
investors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tender
offer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock.
    The company's board has approved the plan, which was
intended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp.
    Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series A
preferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr a
share exercise price before the merger is effective, it said.
    Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possible
leveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December.
    At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it would
consider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,
if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it said
it was told the company had decided against a buyout.
    But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr a
share proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said.
    Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warner
management was asked not to take part in the new deal and it
was conditioned upon payment of the fees.
    In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will also
get up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses in
the tender offer.
    Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warner
as a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their
positions.
    But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it is
considering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number of
subsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger.
    All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130
mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal.
    Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt
of Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said.
    To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects to
borrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln
dlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs of
non-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynch
and Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes to
Merrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs of
subordinated discount debentures.
    GAF has raised its offer to 48 dlrs a share cash.

<title>ECUADOR SAYS WILL RESUME LIMITED OIL PRODUCTION</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, April 13 - </dateline>Ecuador will resume limited crude output
next week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil
to a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state Ecuadorean
Petroleum Corp (CEPE) said.
    CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador
would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in
northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in
preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to
neighbouring Colombia.
    Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an
earthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio,
at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific
port of Balao.
    It will take at least until the end of July to repair the
pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was
pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor.
    To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is
constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying
55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point
of Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco.
    The original target date to resume limited crude output was
May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago

<title>NO TALKS SET ON PROPOSED JAPAN TELECOM MERGER</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 14 - </dateline>No formal talks have been scheduled yet
among companies involved in a controversial proposal to merge
two groups seeking to enter Japan's international

Japan as well as the United States.
    The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by

already the world's largest grain importer.
    Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and
depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food
requirements in 1985.
    Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm
products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on
beef, citrus products and rice.
    Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of
self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice
because potential production is higher than domestic demand.
    The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of
rising production by exporting countries, he added.
    Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product
output with expensive programs, Maki said.

mln pesos have been smuggled into the Philippines over the past

official in the National Food Authority (NFA).
    The official, who was not named, said a large corn shortage
and corruption among customs and Coast Guard personnel have
jeopardised the government's ban on corn imports, which was
aimed at saving foreign currency.

saying monthly corn consumption stood at about 331,000 tonnes
against a national stock inventory of 191,732 tonnes.
    Tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49,150
hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43,725 tonnes of corn
worth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage.

<title>CHINA TRADE DEFICIT FALLS SHARPLY, RESERVES RISE</title>
<dateline>    PEKING, April 17 - </dateline>China's trade deficit in the first
quarter fell to 1.05 billion dlrs from 3.04 billion in the same
1986 period, customs figures show.
    Zhang Zhongji, spokesman of the State Statistical Bureau,
quoted the figures as showing exports rose 27 pct to 7.28
billion dlrs and imports fell 5.1 pct to 8.33 billion.
    He said if imports of gifts, foreign aid items and
materials for joint ventures are excluded, the deficit was only
350 mln dlrs, and the surplus on invisibles was 700 mln. As a
result, foreign exchange reserves increased somewhat from their
level at end-1986, he said, but gave no figure.
    Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrs
at end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.
    Zhang said one reason for the rise in exports was improved
incentives to export firms, which are being allowed to retain
more foreign exchange from the goods they sell.
    He said first quarter exports to Hong Kong and Macao rose
35.5 pct to 2.48 billion dlrs and imports rose 55.3 pct to 1.46
billion. Exports to Japan fell 2.3 pct to 1.28 billion and
imports 24.4 pct to 2.14 billion.
    Exports to the U.S. Rose 23 pct to 640 mln dlrs and imports
fell 26.7 pct to 840 mln. Exports to the EEC rose 35.1 pct to
770 mln dlrs and imports fell 3.8 pct to 1.5 billion, he said.

<title>JAPAN FARM REFORM A KEY TO TRIMMING TRADE SURPLUS</title>
<author>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 17 - </dateline>Basic reform of Japan's protected farm
sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to
domestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade
surplus, securities analysts said.
    The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and
quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and
sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they
said.
    ""In economic terms, reform would be a plus,"" said Christopher
Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co.
    The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices
twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S.,
The analysts said.
    Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the
average household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross
national product (GNP), according to a study by Chew.
    Reducing these prices could increase household spending
power by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on
products which would have a more direct impact in boosting
domestic growth, it added.
    ""There's a lot of slack,"" a U.S. Government official in Tokyo
said. ""All that money could be spent on something else.""
    Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector
amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent
estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37
billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.
    Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm
on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential
development would also give a boost to domestic spending,
economists said.
    ""Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the
expansion of domestic demand,"" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor
at Kyoto Gakuen University.
    Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform
to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic
restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the
farm sector. Employers groups also want change. ""If you really
want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to
raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,"" Bumpei
Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'
Associations told a recent press conference.
    External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek
removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade
deficits with Japan.
    But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well
entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.
    Although the full-time farm population is falling and there
are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban
constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on
farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several
city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.
    The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform
plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,
the analysts said.
    Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the
traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for
national food security, they said.
    Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to
import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms
aimed at stepping up productivity, they said.
    Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific
pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.

<title>JAPAN SEES HIGHER MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH THIS QUARTER</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 17 - </dateline>The Bank of Japan said it forecast
Japan's broadly-defined M-2 money supply average plus
certificates of deposit (CDs) will rise by about nine pct in
the current April-June quarter against 8.5 pct a year earlier.
    Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs rose a preliminary 8.8 pct in
January/March 1987 compared with a nine pct rise a year
earlier, it said.
    The bank said the forecast rise is due to an increase in
floating deposits due to recent low interest rates and a shift
to private banks from the Bank of Japan of 400-1,000 billion
yen by the recently privatised Japanese Railways.

<title>LYNG OPENS JAPAN TALKS ON FARM TRADE BARRIERS</title>
<author>    By Greg McCune</author>
<dateline>    Tokyo, April 17 - </dateline>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
opens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware
his demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrus
markets is likely to be rejected.
     But in an interview with Reuters during the flight to
Tokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an
international spotlight on Japan's agricultural import
protection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open
its markets.
    ""(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, but
they are not going to give us anything,"" Lyng said.
    U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions
during Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessions
would be unveiled later this month, they said.
    ""If there is anything of consequence to offer (Prime
Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him,"" when he
visits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.
    Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by
partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.
    A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week
requesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses
such as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying
Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.
    Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for
beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would
like to buy much more beef than currently allowed.
    He cited the example of a California company which
transports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to
circumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than
the value of the animal, he said.
    U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion
Corporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow
from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986
quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan
has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.
    Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to
eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by
April, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually
be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because
liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese
mandarin orange industry.
    The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because
imports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And
Japanese officials have said.
   Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy
surplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,
but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.
   Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,
including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in
Geneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain
minor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.

<title>JAPAN DETAILS PLAN TO STAVE OFF TRADE PROBLEMS</title>
<dateline>     TOKYO, April 17 - </dateline>Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an
increase in government purchases of foreign goods, the head of
the committee working out the plan, Junichiro Koizumi, said.
    The plan will also urge the government to double 1985's
official development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within five
years instead of seven as the government had promised, senior
LDP officials said at a press conference.
    LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explain
the plan to U.S. Officials when he visits the U.S. On April 19.
    Abe's visit is to prepare for Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone's talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month.
    Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of the
tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated.
However, top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abe
will be able to offer specifics to U.S. Officials.
    The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by

<title>BALDRIGE TO LAUNCH FAR EAST TRADE DRIVE</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 17 - </dateline>U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm

Kong 6.4 billion and China 2.1 billion. The deficit with the
Philippines was 800 mln dlrs.
    Baldrige will meet South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan and
Trade Minister Rha Woong Bae on Monday to discuss opening South
Korean markets to more U.S. Goods.
    Baldrige will be in Peking from April 21 to 24. He will

trade, attend a meeting of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on
Commerce and Trade and address a management and training

    However, U.S. Officials said a chief purpose of Baldrige's
visit would be to discuss relaxed U.S. Rules for transferring
modern technology to Chinese industries.
    In Hong Kong, Baldrige will hold meetings on April 27 with
Governor David Wilson and Trade and Industry Secretary Eric Ho,
as well as addressing the American Chamber of Commerce.
    U.S. Officials said Baldrige will meet Philippines
President Corazon Aquino on April 28 to show continued U.S.

<title>U.S. URGES JAPAN TO OPEN FARM MARKET FURTHER</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 17 - </dateline>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help
Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist
pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.
    Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's Economic
Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister
Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help
Japan as well as the United States.
    The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by
Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.
    However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was
already the world's largest grain importer.
    Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and
depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food
requirements in 1985.
    Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm
products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on
beef, citrus products and rice.
    Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of
self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice
because potential production is higher than domestic demand.
    The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of
rising production by exporting countries, he added.
    Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product
output with expensive programs, Maki said.
    Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions
on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks
at a meeting on April 20, in which U.S. Trade Representative
Clayton Yeutter will join.

<title>REAGAN TO ANNOUNCE DECISION ON JAPAN SANCTIONS</title>
<author>    By Robert Trautman, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 17 - </dateline>President Reagan today is to
announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to
retaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfair
practices in semiconductor trade.
    The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of
Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of
experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.
    Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs
on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors
and television sets to power tools and photographic film.
    The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some
20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa
Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing.
    In his March annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed to
full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide
American industry with free and fair trade opportunities.""
    He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the
pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world
markets and opened its home market to U.S. products.
    U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March
announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  ""we
do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of
action that requires meaningful action.""
    Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,
with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion.
    About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.
    Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to
retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.
    He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent
negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that
existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.
    Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was
as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not
need any new trade legislation.
    The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring
the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the
results showed up.
    U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of
Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and
Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the
Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports.
    Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would
file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade
(GATT).
    It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had
violated the regulations of the global trading group and would
approve compensation or Japanese retaliation.
    U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would
retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with
the United States.

<title>AMOCO &lt;AN&gt; MAY BUY DOME &lt;DMP&gt;, REPORT SAYS</title>
<dateline>    Toronto, April 17 - </dateline>Amoco Corp is apparently the successful
bidder for debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd, according to a
published report.
    The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to the
negotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night with
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3
billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets.
    No financial details about the Amoco offer were available
and a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amoco
had emerged the winner, the newspaper said.
    However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Dome
could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and
Mail said.
    Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available for
comment.
    Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Dome
said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused
to identify them.
    Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco and
Exxon Corp's &lt;XON&gt; 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in
Canada.
    British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP&gt; and Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD&gt;
have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome.
    In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured by
the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,
the only Canadian company in the bidding.
    Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want
to avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the government
gave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to
encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and
officials have said.
    A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run
afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is
asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is
trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,
analysts have said.
    A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreign
oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry.
    Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company,
with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based
Amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its Amoco
Canada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by Amoco Corp.

<dateline>    PARIS, April 17 - </dateline>The French Finance ministry said today a
public flotation offer opening this coming Tuesday for 39 pct
of the capital of &lt;Banque Industrielle et Mobiliere Privee&gt;
(BIMP) has been set at 140 francs per share.
    The offer closes next Friday. The ministry said in a
statement 51 pct of the bank's capital had been sold to a solid
core of large investors, including insurance companies and
Michelin subsidiary SPIKA, for 145 pct of the public offer
price. Ten pct of the shares have been reserved for employees,
who get a five pct discount increased to 20 pct if they keep
the shares for two years.
    Employees also get one free share for each one bought, if
the shares are held for at least one year.
    Small investors would receive one free share for every 10
bought, with an upper limit of five free shares per investor,
and on condition the shares are held for at least 18 months.
    The state-owned capital of BIMP comprises 2.51 mln shares.
The bank is being sold to the public as part of a sweeping
programme to privatise 65 state-owned groups over five years.
    In a separate statement, the ministry said last week's
privatisation offer of 1.07 mln shares in &lt;Banque du Batiment

<title>BUDGET CHIEF MILLER WARNS FED ON INTEREST RATES</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 17 - </dateline>White House Budget chief James
Miller said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve might
""overreact"" to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar by
raising interest rates, a move he said could cause a recession
next year.
    ""Our greatest danger is overreaction,"" Miller told newspaper
reporters yesterday. ""I'm concerned about the Fed's
overreaction. I'm concerned about what I see in recent data
showing a substantial fall in the money supply.""
    Edwin Dale, Miller's spokesman, said the remarks, published
in the New York Times today, were accurate.
    Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact to
signals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move he
said could have ""political consequences.""
    The White House budget chief appeared to be referring to
the effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential
and congressional elections next year.
    ""My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep
soup, and there is no question about it,"" he said.
    Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax
revenues and a widening of the budget deficit.
    Miller's remarks reflected concern that the U.S. central
bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of
bolstering the dollar.
    Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that further
declines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardize
global growth prospects.
    U.S. officials have urged Japan and West Germany to
stimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move that
could boost U.S. exports and relieve trade protectionist
pressures in the United States.

<title>YEUTTER SAYS JAPANESE CURB ALL BUT CERTAIN</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 17 - </dateline>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go
ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.
    Asked in a television interview what the chance was for
Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese
electronic exports, he said ""slim to none.""
    Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to
retaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end
dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than
cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.
    Yeutter, on the NBC program ""Today,"" said the United States
did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop
the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.
    He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials
they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take
time to monitor any compliance.
    Asked how long that would take, he said ""We want to see a
pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would
take a few weeks.""
    Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer
impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods
because the items selected are also readily available from
other countries and manufacturers.
    He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.
    ""It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country
to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that
full well,"" Yeutter said.
    He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but ""that's more of a
paper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any
adverse impact on U.S. trade.""
    Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor
issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit
later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
    He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a
major issue, would be productive but ""I don't see any practical
way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his
visit.""

<title>U.S. COMMERCE TRADE REPORT OMITS FREIGHT COSTS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 17 - </dateline>The Commerce Department said on that
insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billion
dlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 15.1
billion dlrs reported on Tuesday.
    The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after
the initial trade report to issue a second report on a ""customs
value"" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance
charges from the cost of imports.
    Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce
Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion
dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.
    A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the
foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers
said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been
revised downward.
    The Commerce department would like to have the law changed
to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.
    ""My feeling is the second one is a better report but there's
legislation that requires us to delay it two days,"" said Robert
Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.
    ""But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays
any attention to the second figure.""
    The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a
revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.
    The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly
trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in
1979.
    Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes
customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison
with other countries that reported their trade balances on the
same basis.
    The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting
freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable
light for the Reagan administration.
    Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to
eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.
    ""We're considering it,"" he said, ""It's one of those dinosaur
laws and I think it's time has come.""

<title>JAPANESE TARIFFS SEEN AS WORLDWIDE WARNING</title>
<author>    By Robert Trautman, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 17 - </dateline>The tough trade sanctions President
Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across
Japan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade
practices worldwide, U.S. officials said.
    But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings
Institution, a think tank, said ""a shot across their bow can
often result in a shot in our stern.""
    He said it left the United States open to retaliation.
    The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered
on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress
that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,
and no new protectionist legislation is needed.
    In the past year tough trade action had been taken against
the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer
and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,
patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the
tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a ""serious signal""
to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.
    Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,
television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor
an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at
less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The
tariffs were placed on items which were available from other
sources so there would be little effect on the American
consumer, Fitzwater said.
    Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action
- especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade
practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.
    The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.
    The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion
dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about
one-third of America's overall deficit.
    But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West
Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the
president is ready to fight them all.
    Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that ""I regret
that these actions are necessary,"" but that the health and
vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to
American competitiveness in world markets.
    ""We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading
practices,"" Reagan added in the statement from his California
vacation home at Santa Barbara.
    He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan
abided by the agreement.
    U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -
which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he
already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.
    The White House aide said of the tariff action, ""it wasn't
done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade
practice.""
    The aide added, however, ""on another plane, it was an
example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight
unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major
overall of our trade laws.""
    But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not
in the best interests of the United States, and that
negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.
    ""It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,"" he
said, ""because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in
trade.""
    Crandall said, ""the administration is doing this for its
political impact across the country, and therefore its impact
on Congress.""
    He said, ""I don't think it makes a lot of sense.""
    But other analysts said it made little difference whether
the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,
and that the main point was that the trading partners were on
notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.
    Spokesman Fitzwater said ""we don't want a trade war,"" but the
imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when
it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

<title>YEUTTER ALMOST SURE JAPAN WILL NOT RETALIATE</title>

Japanese goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of
a bilateral pact governing semiconductor trade.
    Yeutter did say that U.S. farm products would be targeted
if Tokyo decided to hit back.

something like American agricultural products,"" he said.

<title>FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY</title>
<author>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 23 - </dateline>U.S. banking data released today are
too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary
policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the
Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,
economists said.
    ""It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount
window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate
average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent
with a modest tightening,"" said Dana Johnson of First Chicago
Corp.
    Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that
the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.
    Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were
935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week
statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of
December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.
    Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion
dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this
year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the
Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in
reserves than the Fed had anticipated.
    However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed
is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than
witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have
forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.
    First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week
ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,
partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the
proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to
pay annual income taxes.
    As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the
reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.
    Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion
dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists
said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the
projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to
add reserves too late.
    Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently
left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which
to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists
said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos
outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add
even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.
    ""It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as
much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,""
said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.
    McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting
discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,
equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.
    After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not
tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,
economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging 
overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the
statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.
    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that
the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's
figures, he said, ""It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving
toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture.""
    Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8
pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate
unless the dollar's fall gathers pace.
    Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political
opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time
when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to
reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 23 - </dateline>A congressional study today said the
proposed, but now apparently abandoned, merger of the
Communications Satellite Corp &lt;CQ&gt; and Contel Corp &lt;CTC&gt;
would technically be legal but could violate the spirt of the
law setting up COMSAT.
    Two weeks ago before the study was completed, Contel
announced it would seek to terminate the proposed merger.
    The study by the non partisan Congressional Research
Service (CRS) said ""the proposed merger appears to comply,
technically, with the mandates or letter of statutes, if may
nevertheless violate the spirit of the law.""
    Comsat, created by a 1962 act of Congress, and Contel, a
corporation of local telephone and communications firms, filed
with the Federal Communications Commission last November 3 an
application for merger. Several firms had protested the
proposed merger.
    In an analysis of the law, the research service issued
several critical comments about the structure of the new firm
and said apparent domination by Contel of a restructured COMSAT
would have broken the spirit of the law setting up
COMSAT.COMSAT is the U.S. arm of Intelstat, the international

    ""So long as those discussions continue, no recommendation
will be made to Standard Oil shareholders regarding the offer,""
Standard said.
    Standard directors met at the company's Cleveland
headquarters on Thursday in a regularly scheduled meeting. The

    A committee of independent directors previously obtained an

<title>ECUADOR TO USE COLOMBIA OIL LINK FOR FIVE YEARS</title>
<dateline>    BOGOTA, April 23 - </dateline>Ecuador will use a new pipeline link
with Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years,
Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said.
    The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to
allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5
by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline,
    Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its
OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts
contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador
mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said.
    The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after
signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation
of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling
will begin in September.
    ""The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only
for this emergency period but for the next five years, with
possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels
per day (bpd) will be pumped along it,"" Perry said.
    Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels
through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents
per barrel during the first year.
    The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will
run from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungle
oilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the
Pacific port of Tumaco.
    Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the
Ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures for
Colombia's 11 km segment but said it was ""insignificant compared
with what we are going to earn.""
    OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before
the quake. Lost exports of 185,000 bpd are costing it 90 mln

<title>CHINA PROVINCE BECOMES GRAIN IMPORTER</title>
<dateline>    PEKING, June 1 - </dateline>The south China province of Guangdong is
importing millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas and
other parts of China because farmers have switched from grain
to more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said.
    The official magazine said the province's grain area fell
to 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of a
total farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.
    Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane,
bananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in part
to supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao, the
magazine said. It gave no 1986 area figures.
    The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of national
farmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct under
other crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place.
    It said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity and
low productivity make grain the least profitable farm
commodity. Farmers in one central region of China can from 0.1
hectare earn 2,250 yuan a year from vegetables, 375-450 yuan
from cotton or 225 yuan from grain, it added.
    It said consumer prices for foodgrain can be adjusted only
gradually as part of a reform of the entire pricing system.

<title>SEOUL ANNOUNCES MORE TARIFF CUTS FOR U.S.</title>
<dateline>    SEOUL, June 1 - </dateline>South Korea will cut import taxes on 50
items, including construction equipment, photographic film,
cigarettes and pipe tobacco, to help reduce its trade surplus
with the United States, the finance ministry said.
    The tariff cuts, of between five and 30 percentage points,
take effect on July 1.
    This brings to 157 the number of goods on which import
taxes have been cut this year, a ministry official said.
    The 157 are among about 290 items on which Washington has
asked Seoul to lower tariffs, he added.
    Today's announcement follows Saturday's removal of import
curbs on 170 products. For 46 of those products, the U.S. Had
had sought free access to the South Korean market.
    ""This is in line with the government's policy to limit our
trade surplus with the United States to help reduce trade
friction between the two countries,"" the official said.
    South Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 7.3
billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion in 1985. Officials said
the surplus was expected to widen further in 1987 but Seoul
would try to hold it below eight billion dlrs.
    The finance ministry said tariffs would be cut later this
month on a further 53 items, including acrylic yarn and
ethylene, by an average 7.7 percentage points in order to check
inflation.
    The officials said the tariff cuts would contribute to
holding wholesale and consumer price rises at less than three

<title>U.S. STUDY SAYS TARIFFS AND QUOTAS COULD BACKFIRE</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 1 - </dateline>The use of tariffs and quotas to
reduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will do
little to cut the nation's swelling trade deficit, a government
study said.
    In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said,
such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less
competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of
imported products that are re-exported in different forms.
    ""Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than
help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,"" it said.
    The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilke
and Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which
climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting
currency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand.
    Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as
foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial
competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions
on mergers, added little to the problem, it said.
    ""Although each industry's competitiveness affects the level
of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find
that there have been no significant industry-specific changes
affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in
the overall trade deficit,"" the study said.
    ""To the extent any government action is needed to deal with
the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide
phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,""
the FTC study said.
    Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts
were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report
said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some
domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.
    It also said it found a ""fairly direct relationship"" between
the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting
currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic
demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign
consumer demand.
    The study examined seven factors which have been commonly
blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and
trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of
investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development
in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil
prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.
    In each case, the study found little or no evidence that
the factor had any impact on the trade deficit.

<dateline>    KUWAIT, June 1 - </dateline>The Kuwait Central Bank kept its window
for funds to the domestic interbank deposit market shut as
banks returned from a four day holiday, dealers said.
    The move drove short-term interest rates sharply higher,
with overnight and tomorrow-next funds more than doubling from
last Wednesday and hitting 20 pct.
    There were few offers in a tight market and traders
scrambled for any available funds. One-month to one-year
deposits were indicated one point higher at eight, seven pct
but there was little activity at the longer end of the market.
    Bankers see the suspension of central bank aid as a
deliberate move to drive up Kuwaiti dinar interest rates and
stem a flow of funds out of the country, where market
nervousness is increasing over the growing tension in the Gulf.
    The central bank's move has been combined with a steady cut
in the dinar exchange rate.

0.27758/92 on Wednesday before the four day bank holiday that

<title>PEMEX OFFICIAL SAYS OPEC OUTPUT CRITICAL TO PRICE</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, June 1 - </dateline>Crude oil prices could remain around 18
dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision on
output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an
official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos
(Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.
    Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of
international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared
to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself
for the third quarter. ""Production is surging ahead of what was
originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than
envisaged a few months ago,"" he said.
    He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of
production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the
18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been
envisaged might soften price levels.
    The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in
Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output.
    ""I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in
terms of volume decisions,"" Lajous said.
    A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted
output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is
always there as a possibility, he said.
    ""I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I
expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and
discipline will be maintained,"" he said.
    Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as
this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil
markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during
1987 if output remains under control.
    He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that
increased production was not so important as long as incomes
would not be affected by the output, were ""very relevant and

<title>FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, June 1 - </dateline>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's
forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will
almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be
surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.
    The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'
Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal
Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or
end-of-season stocks.
    However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end
1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln
was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.
    The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast
in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for
soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and
the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.
    This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around
31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of
Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares
against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.
    ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign
will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC
official said.
    Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to
estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and
to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.
    He said, however, that among countries to which France
could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb
countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.
    The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in
1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,
was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize
Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.
    Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were
expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.
    It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,
down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.

Commission (ONGC) plans to drill more wells in the Bombay
offshore area, where a well spudded in February this year gave

    The exploratory well, spudded at a depth of 2,140 metres,
yielded 2,000 barrels of oil and 180,000 cubic metres of gas

    ""The well, one of the four structures drilled in the area 80

    Production of Bombay High, part of the Bombay offshore
field, has stabilised at around 500,000 barrels per day for the
last two years.
    ONGC produced 27.85 mln tonnes of crude in 1986/87 ending

for 20.61 mln tonnes, marginally up from 20.10 the year before.

<title>SAUDI RENEGOTIATION OF ARAMCO DEAL MOVING ALONG</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, JUNE 1 - </dateline>Saudi Arabia's renegotiation of its
collective agreement with Aramco to purchase oil for the
latter's ex-partners is moving along and should lead to a
fundamental structural change in the contract, oil industry
sources said.
    Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in this Monday's edition,
said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34
mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and
volumes and other terms may be rearranged.
    The agreement signed in January for the months from
February to June is up for renegotiation.
    Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mln
bpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp
&lt;XON&gt; 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc &lt;TX&gt; 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp
&lt;MOB&gt; and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV&gt; 550,000 bpd between them.
    But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarter
allowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift its
obligations under the contract
    PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is
to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective
agrement.
    John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of
a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate
schedule although separate agreements with the companies would
favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted
liftings occur .
    ""The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants within
limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long
haul,"" he said.
    Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely
concentrate on volume rather than price.
    Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted
and in April industry publications said that renegotiation were
being sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco.
    Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp &lt;CHV&gt;, Exxon

solicitation of potential buyers for the company.
    The company said it is evaluating the proposals from Paul
Bilzerian and from a third party which is active in the
leveraged buyout field but which Pay N' Pak declined to
identify.
    It said the Bilzerian proposal calls for shareholders to
receive on a blended basis 16.67 dlrs in cash and 3.30 dlrs in
liquidation value of cumulative exchangeable redeemable
preferred stock for each common share.
   
    Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is structured as a
merger in which each holder would receive a combination of
17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation value of 13-1/2
pct cumulative preferred.
    The company said the dividend on the preferred offered by
Bilzerian would be set so that in the opinion his financial
advisor and the company's financial advisor the preferred would
trade in the public market at its liquidation value.
    Dividends on the preferred could be paid at the option of
the surviving corporation in cash or additional shares of
preferred for the first five years, it added..
   
    Pay N' Pak said Bilzerian's proposal is subject to a
physical inventory of merchandise at June 30. Bilzerian did not
provide details with respect to financing of his proposal,
which is not subject to a financing condition.
    The company said dividends on the preferred being offered
in the second proposal would be paid in additional preferred in
the first three years and the preferred would be redeemed in
years 12 and 13.
    It said the second offer is contingent on the arrangement
of financing, adding the party making the offer is confident of
its ability to obtain the balance of the financing.
   
    Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is conditioned upon a
satisfactory agreement with the company's management regarding
its equity participation in the new company.
    The second party anticipates executing a letter of intent
when it delivers its financing commitment to the Pay N' Pak
board that would incorporate an expense reinbursement and

<title>MAXWELL FILES SUIT TO STOP HARCOURT &lt;HBJ&gt;</title>
<dateline>    New York, June 1 - </dateline>Publisher Robert Maxwell's British
Printing and Communicaton Corp PLC said it filed a lawsuit in
U.S. district court against Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, its
directors and advisers to stop, among other things, payment of
the special dividend Harcourt is paying as part of its
recapitalization.
    The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp
&lt;FBC&gt; and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 shares
of super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corp
and the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with
4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan.
    The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have
8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf of
Harcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as a
substantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct
convertible debentures.
    The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds by
more than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available for
dividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulent
conveyance.
    The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose
that one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it
terms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to
repay it.
    Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to
stockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced an
extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed
at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing.
    British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share,
or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the
recapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing its
alternatives.
    British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation
with its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt
failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on
Harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures.
    British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous
increase effective on the June eight record date for the
dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon
conversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged 
Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert
denbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not
have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after
the date.
    British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs
worth of debentures.

OPEC OUTPUT IN MAY SEEN OVER CEILING AT 17 MLN BPD LONDON, June
1 - OPEC's May output appears to have risen well above its 15.8
mln bpd ceiling to 17 mln bpd, and the increase is likely to
put a short-term lid on spot oil prices, Kleinwort Grieveson
Securities says.
    But Kleinwort's latest World Oil Report said re-stocking
and lower non-OPEC output earlier this year should allow the
group to produce up to 17 mln bpd in the current third quarter.
    ""On the supply/demand front, the market continues to enjoy a
degree of stability rarely seen in recent years,"" it said.
    It said most OPEC members were overproducing slightly but
only the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was seriously above quota.
    The report said Saudi Arabia had been sending clear signals
on the need to maintain oil prices at current levels of around
18 dlrs a barrel and adopt provisional output rises agreed in
December when OPEC meets in Vienna on June 25. If OPEC adopts
the provisional ceilings of 16.6 mln bpd in third quarter and
18.3 mln bpd in the fourth, there will probably be room for
overproduction in the third quarter when demand for its crude
will probably be 17.5 to 18 mln, it said.
    It said that the UAE and Ecuador may demand higher quotas
in Vienna, but the biggest obstacle is Iraq, which has refused
to honour its quota as it is less than that of Gulf War enemy
Iran.
    But OPEC appears committed to a short meeting and realises
something must be done about the Iraq issue, the report said.
    According to Kleinwort's sources, Saudi Arabia has already
held separate talks with Iran and Iraq and is urging Iraq to be
more moderate.
    ""One strong indication that some kind of deal may be
eventually worked out is the almost complete silence coming
from Iran,"" it said.
    Indications are that, in return for going along with the
Saudi desire to maintain official prices in Vienna, Iran is
seeking concessions from the kingdom on the Iraq issue, it
said.
    Kleinwort said the kingdom will face an increasingly uphill
task in trying to maintain prices around 18 dlrs beyond 1987.
    Firstly, OPEC hardliners led by Iran are bound to oppose
such a move. Secondly, other OPEC members will press for
another price rise if the dollar remains weak against other
currencies.
    Thirdly, Saudi Arabia may be forced to raise prices earlier
than it intended to ward off growing calls for higher prices
from the U.S. To stimulate domestic drilling and exploration.
    The report concluded that there is a strong possibility
official OPEC prices will rise to 20 dlrs a barrel by end-1987
and 22 dlrs a barrel by end-1988.

<title>U.K. BANKERS CONSIDER NEW ECGD FINANCING PLAN</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, June 1 - </dateline>Representatives of major U.K. Based banks
are meeting here today to consider a new plan for reducing the
cost of financing British exports guaranteed by the Export
Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), senior banking sources
said.
    The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGD
and the Bank of England.
    Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment on
the plan. However, bankers said one of the main points under
discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's medium
term credit portfolio in the international capital markets.

    The proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins
on ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size
and maturity of the credit and the currency.
    The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankers
said that while these rates would reduce a bank's return they
would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when
the government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another
cost reduction plan.
    At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the
ECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existing
government backed credit in the capital markets.

    On credits that are refinanced an original lender would
receive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mln
stg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions.

<title>DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY</title>
<author>    By Marcel Michelson, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    AMSTERDAM, June 1 - </dateline>A cut of about half a percentage point
in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although
economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.
    Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,
encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide
premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,
might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.
    Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances
rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its
repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.
    That rate has remained in force, just holding above the
five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial
bank borrowings.
    Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German
repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,
forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.
    In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to
three pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money
market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans
rate on lending under its three month credit quota.
    Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance
Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.
    In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he
would follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance
Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion
guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct
for an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.
    Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference
between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under
the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add
extra liquidity to the money market.
    Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to
further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would
result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,
provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.
    The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its
parity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673
guilders per 100 marks.
    Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10
guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level
that would not permit a change in the interest rate
differential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers
said.
    An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and
Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he
said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation
expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates
in the longer term.
    In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,
or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts
point to a falling rate of economic growth.
    ""It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement
negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,""
the ABN economist said.
    He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in
January, could also contribute to some inflation.
    At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to
two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,
currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the
second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.
    Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying
spree on the bond market which would bring yields down,
probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below
five pct.
    Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in
the money market.

<title>U.S. TRADE BILL VERY DANGEROUS FOR CANADA, LOBBY</title>
<dateline>    TORONTO, June 1 -  </dateline>A trade bill before the United States
House of Representatives ""is a very dangerous bill for Canadian
industry,"" Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam
Zimmerman told reporters.
    By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S.
countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3
removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely
used government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing.
    ""Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grant
rights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could be
vulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language,"" he
said.
    The Canadian forest lobby's Zimmerman also said the House
of Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuring
subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any
countervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadian
resource exports to the U.S.
    Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices and
U.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, he
said. Such a method would make Canadian resource industries
vulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export tax
imposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumber
to the U.S., Zimmerman added.
    Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a U.S.
forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervail
duty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber.
    ""We represent the first victim of the move to price other
countries' natural resources according to the U.S. system,""
Zimmerman said.
    ""If we're an example, than other resource industries had
better watch out,"" he added.
    Zimmerman said the Canadian Forest Industry Council plans
to discuss concerns about the U.S. trade bill with lobby groups
from other Canadian resource industries.

<title>COMPUTER ASSOC. &lt;CA&gt; BOLSTERS HAND AGAINST IBM</title>
<author>    BY LAWRENCE EDELMAN, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </dateline>Computer Associates International Inc's
800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp &lt;UCE&gt; will eliminate its
strongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competition
from International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM&gt;, Wall Street
analysts said.
     ""IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systems
software,"" said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin
and Jenrette.
    ""But the combination of the two companies will clearly
present a much stronger front,"" he said.
    Besides IBM, ""Computer Associates will be far and away the
most powerful company in the field,"" added E.F. Hutton analyst
Terence Quinn.
    That field is a segment of the market known as system
utilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of
a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,
power and efficiency of large mainframe computers.
    The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the
two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.
Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that
will find the competition much harder than in the past.
    For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a
six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,
N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.
    When the deal is completed sometime in August, the
company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past 
Microsoft Corp &lt;MFST&gt; as the world's largest independent
software vendor.
    Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang
took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought
15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3
mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.
    Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer
businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe
computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.
    Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the
merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.
    On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six
companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.
    For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on
sales of 141.5 mln dlrs.
    The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely
because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,
Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the
dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or
56 cts a share.
   At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different
businesses, only three of which were involved in computer
software. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a
major Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his
job as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE&gt; computer services
unit.
    Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a
news conference that the merger would give computer users a
single source for a wide range of software products.
    In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also
sell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads
in the applications software market, where analysts said it has
been successful with accounting and banking systems.
    Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and
enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the
company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said
about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.
    Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of
current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But
they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute
Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.
    Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of
completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,
he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05
dlrs a share.
    Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations
of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing
and research and development.
    Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.
Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50
dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly
33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.
    Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most
software companies are currently valued at about 20 times
per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the
premium because of its earnings potential and customer base.

    Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25
pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently
owns 58 pct of Uccel.
    The executive said the merger would not alter his target of
maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.
    In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the
deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice
Department.
    Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the
merger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.

Reagan said the American people were aware that ""it is not our
interests alone that are being protected.""
    Saying that allied dependence on gulf oil was no secret,
Reagan declared, ""During the upcoming summit in Venice, we will
be discussing the common security interests shared by the
western democracies in the MIDEAST Gulf.
    ""The future belongs to the brave. Free men should not cower
before such challenges, and they should not expect to stand
alone.""
    Reagan will meet the leaders of Britain, France, West
Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan at the economic summit, which
will take place in Venice June 8-10.
   
    The 13th annual top-level meeting of the major industrial
democracies will take place against a backdrop of rising
congressional concern over Reagan's plan to protect gulf
shipping and demands that the allies do more.
     These concerns were heightened by the May 17 Iraqi missile
attack on the U.S. frigate Stark which killed 37 seamen.
    ""They died while guarding a chokepoint of freedom, deterring
aggression and reaffirming America's willingness to protect its
vital interests,"" Reagan said.
   
    In a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of
the Marshall Plan, Reagan, who spoke to an audience of foreign
affairs experts, also pledged to push for economic expansion by
West Germany and Japan to bolster the world trading system.
    ""While the vibrancy of the U.S. economy has contributed
enormously to the world expansion, preserving a growing world
economy is the business of every member of the world trading
community,"" he said.
   
    ""It will be made clear, especially to our friends in Japan
and the Federal Republic of Germany, that growth-oriented
domestic policies are needed to bolster the world trading
system on which they depend.""
    Reagan coupled this appeal with a call for compliance with
allied accords on exchange rate stability.
    ""Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at
this year's meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in
Paris and in Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten,"" he
said. ""The commitments made at these meetings need to be
translated into action.""

<title>BILZERIAN PREPARED TO TENDER FOR PAY N'PAK &lt;PNP&gt;</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </dateline>Investor Paul Bilzerian said if Pay N'
Pak Stores Inc enters into a merger accord with him he will
immediately begin a tender offer for 7.5 mln shares for 20 dlrs
per share in cash.
    Bilzerian told Reuters he believes his offer is superior to
a leveraged buyout proposal disclosed in an announcement by the
company this morning.
    The company said it is evaluating both proposals.
Bilizerian said he was optimistic his offer will be accepted at
a meeting of the board of directors Wednesday. Officials of Pay
N' Pak did were not immediately available for comment.
 
    Bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised by
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc available for the tender and ""we
may add a bank to that.""
    ""We've submitted an agreement we're prepared to sign,"" he
said. Shares not accepted in Bilzerian's tender would be
exchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock.
    Asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group,
which the company did not identify, topped his offer between
now and the board meeting, Bilzerian said he expected an
opportunity to respond.
    Pay N' Pak gave no details about the buyout group, but did
say the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreement
regarding management's equity participation.
    Bilzerian said it was his understanding that the management
particpation was ""nominal.""
    Pay N' Pak fell 1-1/2 to 19. Arbitrageurs said there was
disappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs.
    ""We were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22
dlrs,"" said one arbitrageur. The leveraged buyout plan was for
17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pct
cumulative preferred stock.

    Robert Cheadle, analyst at Montgomery Securities, said ""you
have to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid.""
    Scott Drysdale, analyst at Birr Wilson Securities, said the
company has not made the best strategic moves over the years.
""They have not done the right things at the right time,"" he
said, and as a result earnings per share have steadily declined
since 1984. The 57 cts per share in earnings reported for the
fiscal year ended in February was lower than 1978's earnings,
he said. Earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mln
dlrs.
    Drysdale said Pay N' Pak has better trained sales people
than many competitors, but it competes on price even though
competitors have lower costs. The result is squeezed margins.
He noted that there have been no other publicly identified
bidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlier
Bilzerian proposal in mid-April.
    Another arbitrageur said it might not be too late for
another bidder to get in the game. He speculated that someone
in the same home improvement business might be able to offer a
deal for stock that would top both the buyout proposal and
Bilzerian's plan.

<title>MAJOR U.S. OIL PIPELINE SHUT DOWN BY FLOODS</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </dateline>Flooding in the Red River on the
Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a
24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per
day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a
Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.
    ""The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any
divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility
that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week,"" a company
source said.
    The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and
one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.
    Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is
restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring
oil which has been lost to the flood.
    ""But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be
difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like
to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to.""
    The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield
Corp &lt;ARC&gt;, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell
Group &lt;RD&gt; and Texaco Inc &lt;TX&gt;, which is the pipeline's
operator.
     Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude
oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to
new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.
    July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to
19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.
    Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of
WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.
    Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline
shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West
Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a
barrel below WTI, respectively.
    Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days
but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River
recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is
dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area
affecting the pipeline, Stevens said.
    He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was
underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.
The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil
nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was
apparently washed away.
   
    The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed
at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this
line.
    Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not
found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,
which is nearby.

<title>USPCI &lt;UPC&gt; SEEN REJECTING UNION PACIFIC BID</title>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, June 1 - USPCI Inc likely will reject a 43-dlr-a-</dateline>share bid made last Wednesday by Union Pacific Corp (UNP), 
analysts said.
    ""The offer is inadequate,"" said Douglas Augenthaler, an
analyst with E.F. Hutton, noting that it does not represent the
needed premium over the company's fundamental value based on
earnings estimates.
    USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at
48-1/8, down 3/8.
    USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he could
not comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the board
would meet to consider it.
    Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34
dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcement
that same day of higher earnings expectations changed its
value. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceed
analysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share.
    At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in the
low 40s, Augenthaler said.
    Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the waste
management concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on the
announcment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90
dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs.
    In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste management
business holds significant growth potential. The industry has
grown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based on
earnings per share, said Jeffrey Klein, an analyst with Kidder
Peabody and Co. The industry is expected to continue growing at
15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said.
    Augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer, or 375 mln dlrs
total, would be a bargain for Union Pacific. The transportation
and energy company would both gain entry into a profitable
business and win cost-control benefits, he said.
    ""Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairly
signficant environmmental problems of its own,"" he said.
    Herb Mee Jr., president of Beard Oil Co (BEC), which holds
a 30.4 pct stake in USPCI, said last week Union Pacific's offer
was ""grossly inadequate.""

<title>ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING TOPS CRAZY EDDIE OFFER</title>
<author>    By Michael Connor, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </dateline>A quickly growing Texas-based
distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs
for Crazy Eddie Inc &lt;crzy&gt;, the leading New York City
electronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than its
founder has bid.
    The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc &lt;em&gt;
for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie
Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada
announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private.
    Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and
profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the
highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer
electronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes of
electronics retailers have sagged.
    The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment
Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose
present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had
the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to
drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns.
    ""I have mixed feelings,"" said analyst Dennis Telzrow of
Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. ""On the one hand
it's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does
Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it
and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?""
    ""It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,"" said
analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a
Minneapolis brokerage. ""Electronics retailing is very management
concentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management in
place.""
    Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already
owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it may
be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its
7-dlr-a-share offer.
    Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high
4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was
announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share
in over-the- counter trading. 
    Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York
City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that
his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares.
    A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken
no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs
since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He
would not comment on the new offer.
    Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as
disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to
retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to
consumers by cable television.
    In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to
87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit
went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.
    Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer,
Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in
a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase
of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to
assist in financing the balance.
    Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to
borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since
Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same
amount.
    Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday
to 9.50.

<title>INVESTORS MAY TAKE COMPUTERLAND PUBLIC</title>
<author>    BY LAWRENCE EDELMAN, REUTERS</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </dateline>The investor group that has agreed to
buy &lt;Computerland Corp&gt; will likely take the leading personal
computer retailer public or sell it to other investors,
industry analysts said.
    ""Now's a good time,"" said Joe Levy of International Data
Corp. ""The personal computer industry has bottomed out and is
on the way up again,"" he said.
    Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PC
retailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought by
an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York.
    Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder,
William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management and
venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the
transaction.
    Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 stores
generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150
mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay
royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company.
    Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to
Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be
reached for comment.
    E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture
capital funds, and its past investments have included Mattel
Inc &lt;MAT&gt; and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a money
manager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management.
   Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strong
upturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make key
changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like
Businessland Inc &lt;BUSL.O&gt; and Tandy Corp's &lt;TAN&gt; Radio Shack
stores. ""The name of the game now is outbound sales forces,
customer service and customer support,"" said Levy of
International Data.

    Relations between Computerland and its franchise owners
have mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give up
managment control of the company in 1985.
    Ed Faber, who took over as chairman and chief executive
officer, revamped the company's royalty plan, which help quell
much of the franchisee dissent.

<title>BURLINGTON &lt;BUR&gt; HEARING TO CONTINUE TOMORROW</title>
<dateline>    Greensboro, N.C., June 1 - </dateline>U.S. District Court Judge Eugene
A. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow on
Burlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stop
Samjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company.
    Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case could
be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover
battle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker.
    Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers
for Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by Dominion
Textile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman.
    Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminary
injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until
the case is decided.
    Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr
buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS&gt;, one dlr per share
lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens
last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens
offer.
    Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and
Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about
the company in making their takeover attempt.
 
    That information, Burlington said, was provided by James
Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber
Group Inc &lt;PWJ&gt;. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23
years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's
sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,
1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to
divulge inside information about the company.
    Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began
working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to
""takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its
management,"" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.
    Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from
PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information
and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or
Burlington's public financial statements.
    Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with
Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with
them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went
public April 24 with their intention to take over the company.
Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a
takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in
February.
    Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held
discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as
financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off
because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and
dominion with a written statement that they did not provide
inside information.
    Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen
withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman
Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and
threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an
effort to takeover Burlilgnton.
    ""The ultimate question is not the price per share or the
profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for
those who would takeover an American company,"" said burlington
lawyer Humphrey.
    Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the
largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in
violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's
largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants
in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,
the lawyers said.
    Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the
market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends
and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light
weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price
dictate.
    Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by
Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid
for Dominion. ""Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose
would have been sauce for the gander,"" said Sidney Rosdeitcher,
a Samjens lawyer.

<title>U.S. TRADE DATA SEEN AS KEY TO DOLLAR TREND</title>
<author>    BY HISANOBU OHSE, REUTERS</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </dateline>The dollar's recent signs of stability
have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,
but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until
after the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.
    ""The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the
dollar has bottomed out,"" said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.
    Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value
against the yen and the mark as part of an officially
orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on
world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.
    On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen
but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,
topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.
    Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far
enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.
    The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March
from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued
improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.
    Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if
further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up
towards 150 yen.
    ""There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed
out for the medium term,"" added Tom Campbell of First National
Bank of Chicago.
    Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing
expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would
be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan's
larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and 
more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.
    The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampen
speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central
bank intervention to support the dollar.
    The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that
the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion
dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount
since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.
    Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's intervention
volume as ""impressive"".
    James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,
however: ""the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the trade
data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and
140 yen.""
    Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York
warned, ""I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet.""
    Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada
said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of
the U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.
    Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction
to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,
which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous
commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.
    President Reagan said today, ""economic policy decisions
made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of
Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be
ignored or forgotten.""
    ""The commitments made at these meetings need to be
translated into action,"" he added in a speech, celebrating the
40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.
    Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,
analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the
brunt of U.S. calls for further action.
    Marine Midland's O'Neill said, ""pressure will build up on
Germany to take stimulative action like Japan.""
    Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar
could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come
under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is
not having much impact on Japan's economy and its trade
surplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trust
banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar
positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign
portfolios, while some others have started covering those short
positions, Japanese bank dealers said.

<title>HARCOURT &lt;HBJ&gt; DEBENTURES MAY TRIGGER SUIT</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </dateline>Holders of convertible subordinated
debentures of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc threatened to sue
the company if they do not get more information about how their
investment will be affected by the company's proposed
recapitalization plan.
    The holders, none of whom was willing to be identified,
said although Harcourt has urged that they convert their shares
to common stock by the June eight record date for a special
dividend, they were unable to determine if it might be better
for them to continue holding the debentures.
   
    ""There are rumors that various houses will bring litigation
if we don't get answers,"" said a Wall Street source. Officials
of Harcourt declined to comment, citing a suit brought by
British publisher Robert Maxwell whose has been trying to
acquire Harcourt.
    Executives of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial
adviser, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
    When it announced its recapitalization May 26 Harcourt
advised holders of the 6-3/8 pct convertible subordinated
debentures due 2011 to convert into common by the June eight
record date for the company's special dividend.
    Harcourt's special dividend pays 40 dlrs per share in cash
plus a security worth 10 dlrs. Holders would also retain stock
in the recapitalized firm.
    The debentures had been convertible at 34 dlrs per share.
Harcourt's May 26 announcement said the conversion price would
be adjusted according to the indenture covering the securities.
Arbitrageurs said the conversion formula yielded a ""negative
number"" and thus they needed further information from the
company.

<title>EQUITICORP TASMAN TO BID FOR MONIER LTD</title>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, June 2 - </dateline>&lt;Equiticorp Tasman Ltd&gt; (ETL) said it will
offer 4.15 dlrs a share cash for all the issued capital of
Monier Ltd &lt;MNRA.S&gt;, currently the subject of a 3.80 dlrs a
share bid by CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S&gt;.
    Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents
cash for each Monier share, it said in a statement.
    As previously reported, ETL moved into the market for
Monier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by
Friday.
    It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign
Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified as
foreign because of its New Zealand base.
    The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28
mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid.
    Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the
alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the
value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the
diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31.
    ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance
conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment
and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.
    ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the
shareholding in Monier was a long term investment.
    ETL and its &lt;Feltex International Ltd&gt; associate have
targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion
and Monier fits well with this aim, he added.
    Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement
that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend
acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid.
    He also said Monier will not now proceed with the
one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on
March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.
    As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex
put and call option deal with Monier's major shareholder,
Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L&gt;, which gives Redland the choice of
accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to
50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing.
    CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland
taking the second option, resulting in the two companies
running Monier as a joint venture.
    CSR officials have also said they had no intention of
raising the company's bid for Monier after ETL's intervention
became public last week.

<title>VENEZUELA TIGHTENS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS</title>
<dateline>    PANAMA CITY, June 1 - </dateline>Venezuela's central bank has ordered
Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange
operations with brokers based outside the country, according to
a copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters.
    The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has
effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's
volatile currency market.
    The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez
Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international
operations.
    The telex said the restriction on business with foreign
brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign
exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign
currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.
    In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied
rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to
prop up the weakening bolivar.
    But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de
facto currency control. ""It is definitely a control in the sense
that there's no longer complete freedom to operate,"" one broker
here said.
    ""Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction
is towards complete control,"" the broker said.
    The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his
Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since
the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with
telephone calls.
    He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume
of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs
a day. ""It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active,"" he
said.
    The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the
prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary
between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.
    ""We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's
ridiculous,"" he said. ""They've been on a rampage against
foreigners.""
    The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central
bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange
business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct
reserve requirement.
    In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in
bolivar futures, the broker said.
    ""We used to have a forward market,"" he said. ""For a small
currency it was miraculous.""
    He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.
Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range
of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running
out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free
market.

"<text>
<title>NO REASON TO CUT RATES - BUNDESBANK'S SCHLESINGER</title>
<author>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, June 2 - </dateline>Bundesbank vice president Helmut
Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.
    With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in
May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,
Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a
further cut in interest rates was needed.
    The economy is picking up, after contracting by a
seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from
the fourth, he added. ""We may have an increase in gnp starting
in the second quarter,"" he said in an interview.
    Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has been
pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its
imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.
    Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was
mainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in
1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.
    He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole
would probably be between one and two pct.
   ""It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic
demand does not grow strongly,"" he said, noting that interest
rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.
    Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money
stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace
of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to six
pct target.
    He said the target could still be achieved but much will
depend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy
inflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS
revaluation, boosted domestic money supply.
    ""There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of
foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit
reversed,"" Schlesinger said.
    A major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction
that the mark was headed higher. ""As we can see from the market,
expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have
diminished,"" Schlesinger said.
    The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the
fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period
and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined
towards stabilizing the dollar, he said.
    Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar
rise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87
marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.
    At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.
    ""Central banks are always in contact about these
fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,""
Schelsinger said.
    ""One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,"" he said,
adding, ""It is not only our own case, it is also the American
case.""
    He said that the West German export industry has been hit
hard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see
some correction now. ""But it wouldn't be good to have short-term
fluctuations,"" he said. ""Let us wait and see.""
    ""It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very
short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level
(of rates) as such,"" Schlesinger said.
    The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of
such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West
German inflation down year.
    Although there have recently been signs of inflation
picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key
commodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would
be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.
    Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth
was longer term, in that the economy was building up the
potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.
    The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16
months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of
targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the
mid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.
    But he added: ""I don't see any great pressure to go away
from it.""

<title>JAPAN OIL INDUSTRY DECONTROL MAY LEAD TO MERGERS</title>
<author>    By Masaru Sato, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, June 2 - </dateline>Deregulation of Japan's oil industry could
mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into
bigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.
    They said the relaxation of controls was now under review
by the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI).
    A spokesman for a major firm said, ""Deregulation would bring
about a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freer
competition, we have no choice but to accept it.""
    The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12.
    The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it
should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It
should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of
current capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and
gasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.
    They said deregulation was vital to promote more
competition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.
    ""Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turn
to see if we can survive cut-throat competition,"" said a source
at one major Japanese oil company.
    A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, ""We'll have a hard
time surviving, but that's something we must go through.""
    ""In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for
the oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out
further into other lines such as real estate and travel
agencies,"" he said.
    Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd
which had the largest share of refined products sales in the
Japanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining
capacity in fiscal 1986.
    Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil products
in 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a
spokesman for the company said.
    Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the
Council, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies
within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the
efficiency of the industry.
    Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to
be streamlined further into five refining groups.
    ""MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to
merge into five to build up their muscles,"" a source said.
    A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out the
possibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry
in the event of the relaxation of oil controls.
    He declined to officially confirm or deny that the
Petroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures but
said that in principal MITI would encourage a move towards
deregulation.

<dateline>    TOKYO, June 2 - </dateline>Japan was ready to use diplomacy to help
maintain the security of the Gulf, Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone said.
    But he told reporters Japan should not cut its lines of
communication with Iran and Iraq because its policy was to take
a broad political stance. Officials of the foreign ministry
said Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran and
Iraq, which have been at war since September 1980.
    Last week Nakasone ruled out Japanese military or financial
help to patrol the waters of the Gulf. About 60 pct of Japan's
crude oil passes through the waterway.
    President Reagan said yesterday the threat to oil routes in
the Gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq was high on the agenda
for next week's G-7 summit in Venice.
    Reagan has approved plans for the United States to step up
its naval presence in the Gulf despite congressional
expressions of concern and he has called on U.S. Allies to help
maintain freedom of navigation.
    Japan's constitution prevents its armed forces from being
deployed overseas. Nakasone has said that Washington

<title>STAD ROTTERDAM TAKES STAKE IN SWISS-OWNED INSURER</title>
<dateline>    ROTTERDAM, June 2 - </dateline>Dutch insurer Stad Rotterdam Anno 1720
N.V. &lt;ASRN.AS&gt; said from July 1 it will own 20 pct of the
shares of &lt;Europeesche Verzekering Maatschappij N.V.&gt;, a
fully-owned unit of Swiss insurer &lt;Union
Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft&gt;.
    Stad Rotterdam chairman Lucas van Leeuwen told Reuters it
may raise its stake to a majority interest if the two companies
are found to be sufficiently compatible.
    Van Leeuwen said that due partly to the fact Europeesche
made losses in 1985 and 1986, the 20 pct stake was obtained at
below the shares' intrinsic value. He gave no precise sum.
    The Europeesche, which specialises in travel and recreation
insurance, had a premium income of 150 mln guilders in 1986.
    Stad Rotterdam's premium income in 1986 was 1.17 billion
guilders, making it the fifth largest Dutch insurer.
    Europeesche made a loss of nine mln guilders in 1985, which
narrowed to 4.5 mln guilders in 1986, van Leeuwen said.
    He said the company was on course for independent recovery
and was expected to reduce its losses further in 1987.

<title>DUFFOUR IGON GIVES BACKING TO AGA TAKEOVER BID</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, June 2 - </dateline>French industrial gas group &lt;Duffour et
Igon&gt; has decided to back the takeover bid by Swedish
industrial gases group Aga AB &lt;AGA.ST&gt;, ending a lengthy battle
between rival bidders from France, Spain and West Germany,
Duffour et Igon Chairman Jean Igon said.
    The board agreed late last night to back the Aga bid and
advise its shareholders to accept the Swedish group's latest
offer of 4,410 francs per share, he told Reuters.
    The other main bidders were Union Carbide Corp's &lt;UK.&gt;
French subsidiary &lt;Union Carbide France&gt; and West Germany's
Linde AG &lt;LING.F&gt;.
    Aga topped rival bids for the gases distribution group in
May by raising its offer to 4,410 francs from 4,000 francs.
    This was accepted by Spain's &lt;Carburos Metalicos SA&gt; which
sold Aga six pct of Duffour et Igon's stock and the right of
first refusal on the remaining nine pct of stock it holds. It
also won over the French Midi-Pyrenees development authority
which agreed to sell Aga its 20 pct stake in Duffour et Igon.
    Under Aga's offer, shareholders can either accept a cash
bid or exchange one share in Duffour et Igon for one bond of a
nominal value of 4,410 francs with a 10 pct coupon issue by Aga
France SA. The bond issue is guaranteed by the parent Aga AB.
    The takeover battle for the Toulouse-based company, which
controls eight pct of the French industrial gas distribution
market, began on April 2 with an offer of 2,100 francs per
share from Union Carbide France &lt;UK&gt;.
    Aga's offer, which puts a price of 587 mln francs on the
company, closes on June 24 and the results will be announced on
July 21.
    Duffour et Igon shares were quoted yesterday at 4,410
francs, with no buyers, after a series of suspensions during
the takeover tussle. They traded at 856 francs on January 9
before the first suspension.

<title>POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK</title>
<author>    By Jonathan Lynn, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, June 2 - </dateline>For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is
the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has
played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for
the last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the
mark.
    President of the powerful and independent West German
central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his
contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the
end of this year, government officials say.
    (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)
    But no official announcement has yet been made, raising
eyebrows in West Germany's business community.
    The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top
ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in
opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.
    There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl
would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own
Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked
closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.
    Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul
Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international
reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.
    Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook
Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor
Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was
Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as
Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.
    In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the
dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of
the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution
which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent
inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts
of galloping inflation this century.
    But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and
inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe
to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the
dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.
    ""I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the
dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the
Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark
would endanger the economy in West Germany,"" he told business
journalists in Frankfurt recently.
    Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that
Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.
    ""Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not
focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external
economy,"" she said.
    An economist at a German bank, who declined to be
identified, said ""If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will
certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so
rigidly oriented towards money supply.""
    One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to
persuade the United States to stop ""talking down"" the dollar. For
Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that
the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise
currencies.
    The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency
dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in
fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.
    ""This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they
don't know - what the central banks can do,"" Poehl says of
intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates
round, making a speculator's position worthless.
    Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist
in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.
    A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over
a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.
    He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and
play golf.
    Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute
for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.
    ""But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount
if you strike at the right moment,"" he said. Bundesbank dealers
are very professional and skilled. ""They've burnt the fingers of
many people,"" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,
the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.

<title>CHINA SEEN UNLIKELY TO RAISE SUGAR IMPORTS</title>
<author>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    PEKING, June 2 - </dateline>China will not increase sugar imports
substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints
and large stocks, despite falling production and rising
domestic demand, traders and the official press said.
    ""Despite rapid increases in domestic production over the
last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to
be extremely serious,"" the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986
plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because
farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical
and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.
    The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop
(November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year
earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.
    The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500
tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier
figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China
News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.
    The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province
fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the
area under sugar was dropping.
    ""Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate,"" the newspaper
said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of
nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane
is a major problem.""
    A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian,
south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in
area planted.
    He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel
developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the
maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.
    The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province
of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667
hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only
70 from one mu of sugarbeet.
    The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to
4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.
    Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed
with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in
falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.
    The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the
official press has said.
    Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of
sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.
    The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln
tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.
    A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks
in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import
sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986
when the central government resumed control of imports.
    ""As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored
in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas,"" the diplomat
said.
    The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to
consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly
as coal had priority. ""How quickly they can move the sugar is
one factor determining import levels,"" he said.
    Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba,
China's major supplier through barter trade, he said.
    ""China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about
152/153 dlrs a tonne,"" he added. ""China is not a desperate buyer
now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into
the open market.""
    A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regarding
imports was price.
    ""While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,
foreign exchange restraints persist,"" he said.
    The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five
pct a year but ""a communist government is in a much better
position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the
foreign exchange situation demands it.""

<title>KUWAIT REJECTS IRANIAN SPY BOAT CHARGES</title>
<dateline>    KUWAIT, June 2 - </dateline>Kuwait, a target of Iranian anger over the
emirate's backing for Iraq in the Gulf war, today rejected
charges that fishing vessels seized recently by Iran were spy
boats.
    ""There are no bases of truth to the contents of the Iranian
accusation on the nature of the operations of the vessels
recently taken into custody by Iran. These vessels were out
fishing,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
    It said Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammad Baqeri was
summoned by the Ministry yesterday to confer with Foreign
Undersecretary Suleiman Majed al-Shaheen.
    The Iranian News Agency IRNA said on Sunday Iran had seized
seven Kuwaiti speed boats and detained their crew, who
confessed to spying for Iraq under the cover of fishing.
    It said the boats were intercepted in the Khur Abdullah
waterway which separates Kuwait and Iraq's Faw peninsula at the
head of the Gulf, captured by Iran last year.
    The Kuwaiti response came as Iranian envoys toured Gulf
Arab states saying responsibility for security and stability in
the waterway was a regional matter. A U.S. Senate team was
scheduled today to meet Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah and the defence and
oil ministers.
    Today's Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the Kuwait
News Agency KUNA, said the recent detention of Kuwaiti fishing
vessels by Iran was not the first.
    Tehran in the past had held back a number of vessels Kuwait
had sought to release through diplomatic contacts, it said.
    ""However, Kuwait is perplexed that this time the Iranian
charges are accompanied by accusations that the vessels were
undertaking espionage activities,"" it said.
    Shaheen condemned the detentions and accusations, and asked
Tehran to free all fishing boats and sailors held by Iran, the
statement said.

<title>TAIWAN CURBS INFLOWS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE</title>
<dateline>    TAIPEI, June 2 - </dateline>Taiwan's central bank announced that as
from today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of local
and foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached at
the end of May.
    The central bank's statement added that the measure would
be effective until the end of July.
    Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of
foreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. They
added that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge
of the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend
foreign exchange to importers and exporters.
    Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks
reached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,
according to official statistics.
    Last week the central bank said that from today it would
reduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40
pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move
was needed because of ""distortions"" in the foreign exchange
market.
    Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar,
have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank
market to avoid exchange rate losses.
    Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May
reached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9
billion in April.
    All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted
into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming
exports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in
the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.
    In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on
remittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to
Taiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money.
    Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of
the local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of
speculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has
flowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S..
    Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about
22 pct against the U.S. Dollar.
    Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the
foreign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on
capital outflows. The central bank has said the controls will
be dropped by the end of July or early August.
    Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement caused
jitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavy
purchases of U.S. Dollars. They said the central bank sold
about 30 mln U.S. Dlrs.
    Taiwan's stock market plunged a record 75.53 points to
close at 1,803.08.

<title>KUWAITI DINAR RATES FIRM, AID WINDOW OPEN</title>
<dateline>    KUWAIT, June 2 - </dateline>Interest rates on Kuwaiti dinar deposits
held firm in scattered trading despite a Central Bank decision
to revive limited funding lines, dealers said.

tendered, but the purchase of all shares tendered along with
the exercise of options it holds would give it over 90 pct of
ARGOSystems, Boeing may buy all shares tendered.
    ARGOSystems has granted Boeing an option to buy up to
1,238,311 new shares or a 15.6 pct interest at 37 dlrs each,

<title>BOMB THREATS, STRIKES AS FIJI SEES END TRADE BAN</title>
<dateline>    SUVA, June 2 - </dateline>Fiji today welcomed the ending of a trade
ban imposed by Australian labor unions as supporters of the
country's ousted prime minister Timoci Bavadra renewed pressure
for his reinstatement with strikes and shop closures.
    The government welcomed a decision by the Australian
Waterside Workers' Federation to lift its ban on shipments to
Fiji, imposed in support of Bavadra, whose newly-elected
government was overthrown in a military coup on May 14.
    The ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat,
fresh vegetables and medicines. A direct result of the union
decision would be the immediate shipment of 9,000 tons of rice
and wheat from an Australian port, the government said.
    Shops in Nadi and Lautoka, center of the country's sugar
industry, closed again today in support of Bavadra.
    In Nadi two bomb threats forced evacuation of the
Australian Westpac bank, but police said they turned out to be
a hoax. Bavadra has launched a campaign of civil disobedience
to press for his reinstatement.

<title>LAWSON SAYS LOUVRE CURRENCY ACCORD SATISFACTORY</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, June 2 - </dateline>The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven
finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies
has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the
economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
    Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce
any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work
remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting
world economic growth.üside measures to boost growth, he said.

    ""I think it is possible that there may be scope for a
further reduction in interest rates in Germany,"" he added, but
stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was
likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.
    Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on ""a gradual reduction
of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.""
    He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced
""satisfactory exchange rate stability,"" in part thanks to heavy
coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and
he was ""content"" with sterling's exchange rate.
    Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May
currency reserves announced today he said, ""we have been playing
a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a
very much greater extent than we had done hitherto.""
    Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may
falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic
commitments underlying the accord.
    ""Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange
rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their
commitments in Paris ... In this respect."" He said the U.S.
Budget deficit was ""very important.""
    Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson
said, ""what is really needed in Japan is an increase in
merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.""
    ""There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural
goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is
wholly unjustified,"" he said.
    Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in ""Japan
bashing"" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation
package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase
Japanese development aid over the next three years.
    Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange
membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.
    He said he thought West Germany would instead come under
pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to
jack up faltering economic growth.
    In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring
forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts
scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with
the privatisation of German national industries.
    On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan
to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to
make progress in Venice.
    The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign
debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World
Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.
    Lawson said he would seek ""to consolidate political backing
for the plan at the Venice summit"" and hoped the programme would
be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.
    He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase
Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt
provisions.
    ""First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market
response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this
sort of move than they felt before Citicorp,"" he said.
    U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,
strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.
""They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,""
Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to
determine the appropriate size of provisions.
    He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be
discussed at the summit. ""There is a consensus, which we have to
push further.""

<title>CSR SAYS IT IS PROCEEDING WITH OFFER FOR MONIER</title>
<author>    By David Skinner, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, June 2 - </dateline>CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S&gt; intends to proceed with
its planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd
&lt;MNRA.S&gt; despite the counter-bid from &lt;Equiticorp Tasman Ltd&gt;
(ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert told Reuters.
    ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier's
issued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative.
This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposed
bid.
    The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealand
entrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct
stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.

    Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L&gt;, which holds
just under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid and
had told CSR it is not a seller.
    He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its
operations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built up
a strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture.
    The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with
Redland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six
months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the
same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.
    CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.

    ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond
describing it as a long term investment.
    ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is
a leader in building materials, Herbert said.
    ""We fit better with Monier,"" he said.
    CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its
core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves
into energy several years ago.
    Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbert
said: ""I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has to
wonder if Monier is the main target.""

    Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a
higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.
    Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its
original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.
    The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on
yesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign
shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review
Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval.
    Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely
to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge
the respective values of ETL and CSR shares.

    ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible
acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a
possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the
negotiations foundered on the price.
    Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not
think ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid
although Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands.
    ""Redland is still in the driving seat,"" said Tim Cohen of
&lt;Ord Minnett Ltd&gt;, adding that Redland would be happier having
CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.
    Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid.

company to compete more effectively in the Virginia market.
    The companies said the agreement is subject to Federal Home
Loan Bank Board approval, expected later this year.
    Additionally, the companies said the converted association
would be managed by a board of directors consisting of the six
current Virginia Federal directors and two representatives of
Montrose Holding.
    The senior management of Virginia Federal was expected to
continue in office after the conversion, the companies said.

<title>ITALIAN BARLEY CROP REPORTED IN GOOD CONDITION</title>
<dateline>    ROME, June 2 - </dateline>Italy's barley crop is generally in good
condition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, the
agricultural marketing information and research board Irvam
said.
    First consignments were expected to be available around
mid-June.
    Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods of
sunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia,
which was expected to lose a large part of its barley crop
because of extreme dryness.
    Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year's low
levels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.
    Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national
production would be around two pct higher than in the previous

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </dateline>The House Agriculture Committee voted
to make approximately 2.8 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiency
payments immediately instead of in the late fall.
    A similar measure was decisively defeated on the Senate

    The bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allow
so-called Findley payments to be made immediately rather than
late this year. Payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would not
be changed.
    Because the bill would move 2.8 billion dlrs of spending

<title>LAWSON CALLS INTERVENTION PROOF OF STABILITY GOAL</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, June 2 - </dateline>The scale of foreign exchange intervention
the Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof of
Britain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed
between the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris in
February, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
    Saying he was ""content"" with sterling's current value, Lawson
told reporters he wanted ""to maintain the exchange rate
stability we have all signed up for."" He declined to say if he
favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels.
 May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion
stg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention.
    In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg.
    Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, ""We have been
playing a very full part ourselves"" in meeting our commitments
toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris.
    ""We wish to see it (stability) continuing,"" he added.
    Asked which techniques were available to preserve
stability, Lawson said both central bank intervention and
interest rate changes could be used to tackle ""the market
pressures there are from time to time.""
    ""Interest rate stability is not an objective in that
sense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times,"" he added.
    Lawson said he expected intervention to be ""sterilised"" by
draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new
issues of government securities and foreign currency sales,
when the market allowed.
    This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention,
he said.
    ""Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not
necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs,"" Lawson
said. ""I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale.""

<title>JUDGE TO DECIDE BURLINGTON &lt;BUR&gt; IN SEVERAL DAYS</title>
<dateline>    Greensboro, N.C., June 2 - </dateline>U.S. District Court Judge Eugene
A. Gordon said he will decide ""in the next few days"" whether to
grant Burlington Industries Inc's request to stop a takeover by
Samjens Acquisition Corp.
    ""I do not know how I come down on this preliminary
injunction,"" Gordon said after listening to arguments by
attorneys for 1-1/2 days.
    ""It's been a long time since I was deluged with as much
information as I have been. I have to consider what's been
presented and issue an opinion on this. Both sides cannot be
winners,"" he said.
    Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeover
effort by Samjens, claiming the partnership used illegally
obtained confidential information about the company to make its
offer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations if
Samjens, formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of
Canada, were to succeed.
    Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for
Burlington from Morgan Stanley Group &lt;MS&gt; by one dlr per share.
Morgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid
72 dlrs per share for Burlington.
    Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not
granted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjens
lawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would
""kill the offer""
    Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said the
partnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction
were granted. ""There's only one Burlington,"" he said. ""If we
cannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us.""
    Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings in
Burlington for 95 mln dlrs. ""We don't want that. We're not in
this for the money,"" he said.
    Irving Nathan, a Burlington lawyer, reiterated that
information provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington
executive, was crucial to Dominion's decision to attempt o
takeover of Burlington.
    ""Dominion relied on the information provided by the insider
Jim Ammeen,"" Nathan said.
    An attorney for Ammeen, who is named as a defendant, asked
the court to dismiss the lawsuit against his client. The judge
said he would not rule on the request today.

limited partnership to sell selected hotels in Canada to the
public.
    It said the offering is expected to raise in excess of 350
mln Canadian dlrs and will be completed by the end of
September.
    The limited partnership will be similar to the Westin
Hotels limited partnership completed last year when Allegis
sold Westin hotels in San Francisco and Chicago. Allegis
reported a pretax gain of 80.6 mln dlrs as a result of that
partnership.
   
    An Allegis spokesman said the offerings have been in
planning stages for a long time and are unrelated to recent
corporate developments such as the firm's recapitalization plan
and a threatened takeover by an investor group lead by Coniston
Partners and the pilots of its United Airlines unit.
    The spokesman said the company has not yet identified which
of its Canadian hotels will be offered for sale.
    Allegis has 100 pct ownership in Westin hotels in
Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa and Toronto, and 100 pct interest in
Hilton International hotels in Toronto and Montreal. It owns 60
pct of the Westin in Edmonton.
    Richard Ferris, chairman of Allegis, said in a statement
the hotel limited partnerships allow the company to convert
unrecognized asset appreciation into cash.
    As with the proceeds from the earlier limited partnership,
the money will be used for general corporate needs, the

<title>BUNDESBANK CREDIT POLICY CHANGES UNLIKELY</title>
<author>    By Jonathan Lynn, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, June 2 - </dateline>The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday
for its last session before the Venice summit, banking
economists and money market dealers said.
    The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month
by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is
unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates
in the near future, they said.
    The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will
be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.
    But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was
usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and
did not necessarily herald any policy moves.
    Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today
there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply
growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was
stable against the mark.
    Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has
opened a representative office, that the West German economy
was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted
1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.
    Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in
a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the
Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a
minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.
    ""They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe
lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or
Lombard,"" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,
Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.
    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said
German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and
around historical lows for West Germany.
    A further cut in rates would have little impact on the
economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,
with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.
    The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move
on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.
""The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,"" he said.
    A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in
line with the new structure of money market rates since last
month, would have little practical significance, dealers said.
    The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a
diplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.
    But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it
clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere ""eyewash.""
    Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to
cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary
policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.
    But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax
cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget
deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.
    ""The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in
Venice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,""
said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.
    Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before
Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. ""But I
don't expect any convincing measures,"" he said.
    Money market dealers noted that call money continued to
normalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday
and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by
month-end distortions.
    Call money could come under upwards pressure later this
month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on
behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.
Two public holidays that week could also distort the market.
    Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds
tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55
pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,
and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.
    But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would
allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not
represent a tightening of policy, however.
    Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates
at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full
allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.
    On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely
to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency
Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.
    Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement
on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the
Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French
occupation this century.
    But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come
this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still
to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be
treated for minimum reserve purposes.

<title>U.S. WEIGHS LIFTING JAPANESE TRADE CURBS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </dateline>The White House has completed a new
review of Japanese semiconductor trading practices but has not
yet decided whether trade sanctions levied against Japan last
April should be lifted, U.S. officials said.
    They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked at
Japan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact
yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.
    But there was no hint what the announcement might be.
    Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of
Japanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to be
honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.
    But they also noted that the White House has said it was
unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the
world's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10.
    The officials added that while the curbs complicated
U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt 
Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not
taking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.
    Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for
Japan's failure to honor commitments to end dumping
semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs

<title>ENERGY SECRETARY SEES HIGHER OIL PRICES</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </dateline>Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he
expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000,
probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.
    ""I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000).
Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable,"" Hodel told the
Senate Energy Committee.
    Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through
the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells
because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was
also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.
    Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section
1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said
geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery
of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.
    ""The area could contain potentially recoverable oil
resources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearly
equal to the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently provides
almost one-fifth of U.S. domestic production,"" Hodel said.
    He said production from the new section could begin about

<title>LEUTWILER WANTS FIRMER MARK AGAINST SFR</title>
<dateline>    BADEN, Switzerland, June 2 - </dateline>Fritz Leutwiler, chairman of
BBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie and a former Swiss National Bank
president, urged the National Bank to declare its intent of
achieving a rising rate for the mark against the Swiss franc.
    In a speech to shareholders, Leutwiler said, ""A gradually
rising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would be
desirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and with
regard to sustaining Swiss industry.""
    ""Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank of
issue (Swiss National Bank) could have a positive effect,"" he
said.
    Leutwiler, who served 10 years as head of the Swiss central
bank, said such a step would not contradict the National Bank's
target of monetary stability.
    ""Bringing the franc close to the mark would, of course, have
to be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetary
policy,"" he told shareholders. ""Realistically there is in fact no
persuasive reason why the German currency is quoted almost 20
pct lower than the Swiss.""
    A National Bank spokesman said the relation of the mark and
Swiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over a
long period of time.
    The spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market,
not the central bank, and it would be impossible to influence
individual parities separately.
    Leutwiler said the Swiss National Bank could not support
the value of the dollar, even in conjunction with other central
banks, without putting monetary stability in jeopardy.
    ""I would be the last to recommend that. The key to a
stronger dollar lies in the United States itself,"" Leutwiler
said.

<title>SPECTRA-PHYSICS &lt;SPY&gt; MULLS SALE, RESTRUCTURE</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </dateline>Spectra-Physics Inc said it is
considering the possibility of recapitalizing, restructuring,
or seeking a buyer for the company following its rejection of
an unsolicitied 32 dlr a share bid from Ciba-Geigy Corp.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the San Jose, Calif., gas lasers and accessories company also
said its board Sunday agreed to a plan that gives 52 top
executives bonuses ranging from 20 to 50 pct of their base
salary if they stay with the company through August 29.
    In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiary
of Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG, the company said it was unfair.
    The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously, with two
Ciba-Geigy representatives not participating, to reject the
Swiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid,
citing an opinion from its financial advsior, Morgan Stanley
and Co Inc, that it is ""inadequate and unfair from a financial
point of view to the holders of shares,"" the company said.
    The board also authorized a special committee and Morgan
Stanley to ""vigorously investigate, pursue and authorize any
alternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders'
investment in the company,"" the company said.
    Among the alternatives the special committee will consider
are a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32
dlrs a share, a recapitalization or restructuring, including
self tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use of
dividends, Spectra-Physics said.
    The ""retention plan"" for the 52 top officers will pay an
average bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary, it said.
    Spectra-Physics said its board approved the plan ""in order
to encourage key operating personnel to remain with the company
during the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the
(Ciba-Geigy) offer.""
    Under the plan, the executives would be entitled to their
cash bonuses if they stay with the company through August 29,
but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasons
other than gross and willful misconduct, or if they leave the
company because their salaries have been sharply cut.
    Spectra-Physics also said it filed suit against Ciba-Geigy
yesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., charging
it with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading in
violation of securities law and with violating the intent of
July 9, 1985 standstill agreement.
    Spectra-Physics said Ciba-Geigy indicated at the time of
the standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicited
takeover proposal for the company and that the intent of the
agreement was that Ciba-Geigy would not acquire more than 20
pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat.
    Ciba-Geigy was 18.8 pct of Spectra-Physics and Reliance
Group Holdings &lt;REL&gt;, which is controlled by New York investor
Saul Steinberg, controls 12.8 pct.
    Spectra-Physics said the agreement prevents Ciba-Geigy from
raising its stake beyond 20 pct through Jan 1, 1992, unless
another person get more than 10 pct of its voting power.

<title>VOLCKER DEPARTURE REVIVES DLR, INFLATION FEARS</title>
<author>    by Jeremy Solomons, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    New York, June 2 - </dateline>Paul Volcker's decision not to go for a
third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of
Alan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about
the U.S.' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem
rising inflation, financial market analysts said.
    Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation
fighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing in
the U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enough
political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough
campaign against inflation over the next year or two.
    ""The critical issue is how (Greenspan) will deal with
inflation,"" said Stephen Axilrod, Vice Chairman of Nikko
Securities Co International Inc and former staff director for
monetary and financial policy at the Fed.
    ""A lot of questions have been raised by Volcker's
departure. Until Greenspan answers them, the markets will
remain nervous,"" added Stephen Slifer, money market economist
at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.
    This morning's announcement sent the dollar into a
tailspin, which was halted only by concerted central bank
intervention in the open currency market.

<title>SHULTZ WELCOMES TOKYO ECONOMIC PACKAGE</title>
<dateline>    ROME, June 2 - </dateline>U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said
the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo last
week went further than the U.S. Had expected.
    But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic
sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo
changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips.
    Speaking in a televised news conference linking several
European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the
Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and
global demand.

    ""There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was
originally thought,"" said Shultz, speaking from Washington.
    ""It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked
about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.
    ""It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe
that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the
economy,"" he added.
    But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news
conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might
decide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on
some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:
    ""These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an
agreement that had been reached between the United States and
Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip
market.
    ""They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the
agreement that it made become evident.""
    He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the
situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a
trend on only one month's data.
    The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal
computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that
Japan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by
selling computer chips at below fair market value.
    Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do
well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.
    Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to
take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold
American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget
deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the
problem.
    He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit
would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against
last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would
contain a major reduction.

<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </dateline>The operator of a major U.S. crude oil
pipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may be
several days before repairs are made and the system is
functioning again.
    Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
Texaco Inc &lt;TX&gt;, operator of the pipeline through its
subsidiary Texaco Pipeline Co, said the company hopes repairs
will begin in about five days and expects it to take several
more days to complete.
    ""At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to get
the job done,"" Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairs
will depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult to
assess because of flooding on the Red River.
    The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude
oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days
preceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said.
    The pipeline was shut down from Cushing, Okla, to Witchita

<title>LYNCH &lt;LGL&gt; PLANS OFFER FOR BECOR &lt;BCW&gt; STOCK</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </dateline>Lynch Corp said it will offer 10.50 dlrs
a share in cash, 4.50 dlrs in subordinated debentures and a 1/4
share in a new company for each Becor Western Inc share
outstanding.
    Lynch said its proposed offer ""substantially improves"" over
the offer of 10.45 dlrs a share in cash and 4.00 dlrs of senior
sinking fund debentures made by BCW Acquisition Inc, formed by
Becor's management.
    Lynch Chairman Mario Gabelli, who heads a group which owns
12.35 pct of Becor's 16.5 mln outstanding shares, said the
Lynch bid ""is about one dlr better than the present offer.""
   
    Gabelli previously said in a filing with the Securities and

unfar.
    The Lynch officer said he was invited by other Becor
shareholders to make an offer.
    Following sale of Becor's aerospace subsidiary in February,
the management group led by President William Winter announced
plans for a 238.1 mln dlr leveraged buyout. was planning to

<title>OVERSEAS &lt;OSG&gt; SEES OPEC QUOTAS KEY TO RATES</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </dateline>Overseas Shipholding Group Inc president
Morton Hyman said if oil production by OPEC rises during the
second half of 1987, freight rates for tankers should rise
accordingly.
    Hyman, delivering a speech at the annual shareholders
meeting, said international tanker markets were generally weak
throughout the first quarter, but since the end of March OPEC
oil production has picked up. The result has been a modest
improvement in tanker rates.
    Overseas said 73 pct of its fleet handles liquid cargo.
   
    He said tanker requirements decreased in September 1986 as
OPEC production quotas dropped and levels of oil stocks rose.
    For the first quarter 1987, the company reported net income
of 10.3 mln dlrs, or 40 cts per share, compared to 9.3 mln
dlrs, or 36 cts per share, for the comparable quarter a year
ago.
    The company reported net income for 1986 of 37.3 mln dlrs,
or 1.45 dlrs per share.
   
    ""The improvement in the company's 1986 results, after four
years of declining earnings, reflects a sharp, albeit
temporary, rise in freight rates in the international tanker
markets last summer,"" Hyman said.
    He said the Alaskan oil trade continues to be the principal
source of employment for its U.S. flag tanker fleet, which
represents approximately 15 pct of the company's tonnage.
    Overseas owns and operates 67 vessels.

<title>U.S. TO PROTECT ONLY AMERICAN SHIPS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </dateline>U.S. military forces in the Mideast
Gulf are under orders to protect only American flag vessels and
occasional U.S. arms deliveries on other ships to
""non-belligerent"" states in the area, the Pentagon said today.
    ""No one has ever stated or supported a policy of protecting
all shipping in those waters,"" Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims said
as the Reagan Administration drew up plans to increase the
protective U.S. military presence in the gulf.
    Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutral
shipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq.
    ""As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels are
under our protection with the exception, on a limited
case-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign Military
Sales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in the
region,"" Sims said.
    U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaiti
ship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain and
Kuwait. But Sims said Washington had received assurances that
the the arms would not be used elsewhere.
    He said Kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over to
U.S. firms to fly the American flag and be protected by the
U.S. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite Iranian
charges that Kuwait is supporting Iraq in the gulf war.
    Kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated Iranian attack.
    Sims refused to say how the United States will beef up its
seven-ship Middle East Task Force in the gulf to protect the 11
Kuaiti tankers. But Pentagon officials said that additional
ships and air cover are under consideration.

<title>HOLLLINGER &lt;HLG.TO&gt; PAYING 50 MLN DLRS FOR BUY</title>
<dateline>    TORONTO, June 2 - </dateline>Hollinger Inc will pay about 50 mln dlrs
cash for its previously reported acquisition of privately owned
Unimedia Inc, chairman Conrad Black told reporters after the
annual meeting, confirming a published report.
    Commenting on press reports about the 50 mln dlr price tag,
Black said, ""That would not be wildly inaccurate,"" although he
declined to disclose the actual cost.
    Montreal-based Unimedia is Quebec's third largest newspaper
group, with three French language daily newspapers in Quebec
City, Ottawa and Chicoutimi, Quebec and four printing plants in
Ontario and Quebec.
    Black added that Hollinger would also continue seeking
acquisitions of daily newspapers with circulation under 25,000
readers. He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10
such newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23
dailies.
    ""There is really no end to the ones that are available,"" he
told reporters, although he added that most remaining
acquisition opportunities are in the U.S.
    He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC,
of London, should become profitable in this year's fourth
quarter.
   
    For full-year 1987, the Daily Telegraph could break even or
better, said Black, citing major reductions in labor costs and
improved technology at the Telegraph, Britain's largest
circulation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadian
dlrs last year.
    Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight told
reporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's daily
circulation had risen by 25,000 since September to about
1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the new
Independent daily newspaper.
   
    Knight said The Independent was not affecting the
Telegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulation
of other London quality dailies such as The Times and The
Guardian.
    Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post
1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share,
including extraordinary gains from previous sales of
discontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54
dlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after an
extraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs.
   
    Black told shareholders that first quarter operating
earnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrs
against a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs.
    Revenues on continuing operations rose to 102.1 mln dlrs
from 1.5 mln dlrs last year, which did not include Daily
Telegraph revenues, he added. Consolidated first quarter
figures were not disclosed.
    He said the Daily Telegraph's first quarter operating loss
was sharply reduced from last year.

<title>REAGAN SEEKS ROMANIA TRADE CONCESSION</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </dateline>President Reagan called for continued
nondiscriminatory treatment for Romanian exports to the United
States in the face of congressional opposition because of the
Bucharest government's record on human rights.
    A White House statement said Reagan's decision to press for
continuation of so-called Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for
Romania had been ""exceptionally difficult"" and came after ""all
options were seriously considered.""
    But the statement said that despite concerns about human
rights abuses by the Bucharest government, the president had
decided that should be continued because it helped stimulate
emigration from Romania and gave the United States influence on
human rights practices there.
    The statement was issued as Reagan sent to Congress
requests for one-year extensions of MFN for Romania, Hungary
and China.
    The House of Representatives has attached to a trade bill
legislation that would temporarily deny MFN for Romania pending
certification by Reagan that the country had made progress on
human rights. There is no controversy over continuation of MFN
for Hungary and China.

<title>LAST-MINUTE OPPOSITION TO GULF BILL ARISES</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </dateline>House Speaker Jim Wright predicted
passage of legislation requiring the Reagan administration to
provide Congress with a report on its Mideast Gulf policy, but
a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals and
conservatives left the bill's fate in doubt.
    The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17th
Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,
which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision to
protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags
-- effectively making them American ships.
    Since the administration made known its reflagging plans,
congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted,
and some charged the policy could lead the United States into
the 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.
    The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the
Democratic and Republican congressional leadership and the
administration -- which demanded a report within seven days on
plans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf.
    The resolution was expected to pass without controversy
today in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the full
House was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberal
Democrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joined
in an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution.
    Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the
bill implied consent to Reagan's policies.

    The department said the provision of the Farm Disaster

producers, producers of other types of wheat who were prevented

disaster, and all producers who operate farms with program crop

program may become eligible by signing-up no later than July

applications are being accepted, it said.
    The department said producers of wheat other than winter
wheat may use the 0/92 option if they were preventedf from
planting their intended acreage with wheat for harvest in 1987
because of any natural disasters which occured in 1986 or if
the farm is located in a county approved by Farmers Home

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </dateline>After a highly favorable reception of

last February, the Senegalese appear ready to take delivery of
a first tranche of 10,500 tonnes of mixed U.S. wheat, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In its report on U.S. Export Markets for U.S. Grain, the
department noted Senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheat
under the Export Enhancement Program last November, but local
opposition from millers, accustomed to French wheat, has been
delaying deliveries.
    As a result there were a series of baking seminars as well
as the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millers
and convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat.
    The department said if deliveries of U.S. wheat to Senegal
remain on track, the U.S. could dominate a wheat market that
had been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly French
wheat during the 1987/88 (July-June) season.

<title>INVESTMENT CRUCIAL TO U.S. TEXTILE RECOVERY</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </dateline>With more private investment, not more
protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive
with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two
congressional agencies said today.
    The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of
Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing
there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S.
textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for
optimism than a few years ago.
    ""While textile producers are making significant
investments, they could do more,"" OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.
    The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan
budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan
guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than
increased trade protection which could lead to foreign
retaliation.
    CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections,
first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for
profits and investments of domestic firms.
    Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the
agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against
congressional approval of protectionist textile quota
legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other
Asian textile producing countries.
    President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill
but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is
expected to be voted on in the House this year.
    However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of
a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles
showed a weakening of support for the legislation.
    Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign
producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production
equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic
markets, Kelly said.
    He added that private investment in the textile and
clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh
the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.
    Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of
textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct
while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.
    ""The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by
new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the
industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets
that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research
indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,
and that exports can be expanded,"" Kelly said.

<title>PHELPS DODGE &lt;PD&gt; SETS SIGHTS ON ACQUISITION</title>
<author>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </dateline>Phelps Dodge Corp chairman G. Robert
Durham said the company is prepared to make another large
non-copper acquisition and that a deal could be struck in the
near future.
    In an interview with Reuters, Durham said the company was
examining potential candidates but not yet talking with any.
    He declined to name the companies but said a deal could
occur as soon as the second half of 1987.
   
    Phelps Dodge, which ranks as the largest copper producer in
the U.S., last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals
Co, a maker of carbon black which is used in rubber and tires
among other products.
    The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and
eventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copper
operations.
    Phelps Dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs
to buy another non-copper company, Durham said, citing about
100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.
   
    Any acquisition candidate would have to have a different
economic cycle than copper, substantial earnings and good
management, he said. Phelps Dodge would only want a friendly
deal, he added.
    ""We're not talking high-tech, or financial services or
about a perfume company,"" he said. ""We want a good basic
industrial company that will fit into our management
structure,"" Durham said.
   
    During the interview, Durham and other executives also said
continued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead to
higher prices for the metal.
    ""In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price
(for copper) will improve because there aren't that many new
projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,
will continue to grow modestly,"" said executive vice president
Douglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost of
producing copper, the executives said. Costs should be below 50
cents a pound, after depreciation but before interest and
corporate expense, by 1989 or 1990.
    Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound now
compared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some Wall St analysts
said.
    Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have been
for almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong.
    He declined to project results for the second quarter or
year. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise in
copper prices in the last month will help results.
    Durham said last month that the second quarter should match
the first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mln
dlrs or 49 cts a share.
    First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs,
reflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increased
copper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico, also
acquired last year.
    Analysts are projecting 1987 earnings of 2.20 dlrs to 2.75
dlrs a share, up sharply from 1.79 dlrs in 1986.

<title>AMOCO &lt;AN&gt; SAYS DOME &lt;DMP&gt; BUY GOOD FOR CANADA</title>
<dateline>    EDMONTON, Alberta, June 2 - </dateline>Amoco Corp's wholly owned Amoco
Canada Petroleum Co Ltd said its proposed 5.22-billion-
Canadian-dlr acquisition of Dome Petroleum Ltd will benefit
Canada just like the foreign investment that made possible
commercial development of Alberta's oilsands.
    Amoco Canada president T. Don Stacy told an oilsands
conference that ""Amoco Canada has presented the solution to the
Dome problem, and we're investing our confidence, dollars and
determination to make that solution work.""
    The Amoco buyout of debt-burdened Dome has angered Canadian
nationalists, who want a Canadian buyer for Dome.
    Stacy described Amoco Canada's previously reported share
offer proposal as a chance to increase Canadian ownership of
the country's oil and gas industry, now at about 50 pct.
    He reiterated that Amoco planned virtually no layoffs of
Dome employees. He also reaffirmed that Amoco would reinvest in
Amoco Canada-Dome properties all available cash flow for five
years after the acquisition.

<title>U.S. HOUSE PASSES GULF BILL DESPITE OPPOSITION</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </dateline>The U.S. House of Representatives 
approved a bill that requires the Reagan administration to
provide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does not
place any restrictions on its actions.
    The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds
of those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance
of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to
defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators
oppose President Reagan's policies in the region.
    The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17th
Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,
which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11
Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags --
effectively making them American ships.
    The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic and
Republican leadership as well as by the administration --
required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide a
report to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to
protect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf.
    It did not, however, place any restrictions on the
administration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships and
thus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy.
    The Senate was expected to approve the legislation this
week. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature.
    Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a
first step toward a greater congressional involvement in
formulating policy.
    But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask the
administration to address tough policy questions in the report.

French force with cooperation from the Gulf Arab states.

<title>NEAR TERM STRENGTH SEEN FOR CURRENCY FUTURES</title>
<author>    by Patricia Campbell, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, June 2 - </dateline>Currency futures are likely to move
higher following the sharp rally today after President Reagan
announced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term as
Federal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominated
as his replacement, currency analysts said.
    Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,
analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between
now and the June 8 Venice economic summit.
    In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude to
the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,
analysts said.
    Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing
a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in
Chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a
technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,
analysts said.
   
    ""Disappointment of European central bankers over the
appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar
lower,"" said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol
Mackoff.
    ""The international community will not like this
appointment,"" as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.
budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and
that Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to
reduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David
Horner.
     Furthermore, ""that Greenspan was not named two months ago
suggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --
and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,""
Horner said.
    A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures
prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigated
only by concrete action as opposed to ""jawboning"" at the G-7
summit, he said.
    But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may
be at an impasse, analysts said.
    Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neither
planned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the
U.S. to do so, Mackoff said.
    The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit
as Japan and West Germany have urged, she said.
    Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut its
budget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the
dollar could be forestalled, Horner said.
    However, ""the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing
changes,"" Horner said.
    Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane
said European currencies will likely move to the higher end of
their 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance.
    For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for September yen
futures to advance toward the 0.007200 area. He said September
marks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target, while Swiss
francs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950.

<title>DAIRY FARM BIDS 146.6 MLN STG FOR 22 PCT KWIK SAVE</title>
<dateline>    HONG KONG, June 18 - </dateline>&lt;Dairy Farm International Holdings
Ltd&gt; said in a statement it is making a tender offer for 22 pct
of Kwik Save Discount Group Plc &lt;KWIK.L&gt; of Britain for a total
146.6 mln stg.
    Dairy Farm said it will offer to buy up to 32.58 mln Kwik
Save shares at 4.50 stg each.
    The offer will bring Dairy Farm's stake in Kwik Save to 25
pct from the present 3.5 pct, or 5.25 mln shares.
    The offer, which will begin on Monday and ends June 30,
requires that the shares tendered will bring its stake to at
least 15 pct.
    Dairy Farm said it will finance the acquisition by placing
89 mln shares with affiliate Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd
&lt;JARS.HK&gt; at 5.10 H.K. Dlrs each for a total of 454 mln dlrs.
    The placement will raise Jardine Strategic's stake in Dairy
Farm to 39.75 pct from the current 35.3 pct.
    It said the Kwik Save purchase will also be financed with a
loan from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp &lt;HKBH.HK&gt;. It
did not give the size of the loan but it said it would raise
its net bank borrowings to a maximum of 2.2 billion H.K. Dlrs.
    Dairy Farm said it would reduce its bank borrowings by the
proceeds from the previously announced sale of its office
building in Sydney for 625 mln dlrs.
    It will consider raising additional capital, most probably
through a placement of convertible preference shares in the
Euromarket, it added.
    Company chairman Simon Keswick said the U.K. Market ""offers
attractive opportunities for competitively priced food
retailers"" and that ""a strategic investment in Kwik Save offers
the best vehicle to pursue those opportunities.""

<title>GOVERNMENT TO SELL 25 PCT OF AIR NEW ZEALAND</title>
<dateline>    WELLINGTON, June 18 - </dateline>The New Zealand Government will sell
25 pct of state-owned &lt;Air New Zealand Ltd&gt; to the public,
Civil Aviation minister Richard Prebble said.
    Prebble said in a statement the government would appoint an
adviser to help it decide how the shares should be sold, the
timing of any sales and the price.
    ""Clearly there will be a need to gauge the effect of other
proposed share issues so as to enter the market at the best
opportunity,"" Prebble said.
    ""We are in no particular rush to sell our shares in Air New
Zealand,"" he said.
    ""Our aim is to maximise the benefit to the taxpayer. If that
means waiting for a while, then so be it,"" Prebble said.
    He said Air New Zealand expects to release its results soon
for the year to March 31 1987. He said he was confident it
would post an excellent profit.
    Prebble said Air New Zealand was successful but its ability
to prosper in future was hampered by its
wholly-government-owned status.
    Prebble said access to new sources of capital would
increase its ability to expand and develop.
    This sale announcement follows the public float in March of
around 13 pct of the &lt;Bank of New Zealand Ltd&gt;.
    The government has said it will also float part of the
capital of other state-owned operations, including &lt;DFC New

<title>TOSHIBA, SHARP RESTRAIN LAP-TOP PC EXPORTS TO EC</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, June 18 - </dateline>Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T&gt; and Sharp Corp
&lt;SHRP.T&gt; decided to maintain exports of lap-top personal
computers to the European Community (EC) at last year's levels,
despite the halt of shipments to the U.S., Company spokesmen
told Reuters.
    They said the voluntary restraints were aimed at averting
EC sanctions urged by European computer makers. The Europeans
feared Japanese personal computers would flood EC markets after
Washington imposed 100 pct tariffs last April.
    Toshiba and Sharp together control about 40 pct of the
personal computer market in the EC, the Sharp spokesman said.
    Toshiba said exports of T1100 and T3100 lap-top computers
would continue at 5,000 units a month for the time being.
    Sharp said exports to the EC of PC 7000 series lap-top
personal computers would continue at last year's level of
12,000 to 16,000 units a year.
    Washington imposed the tariffs because of Japan's alleged
failure to uphold a 1986 agreement on semiconductor trade.

<title>BELGIUM CUTS TREASURY CERTIFICATE RATES</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, June 18 - </dateline>The Belgian National Bank said it cut
one, two, and three month treasury certificate rates, all by
0.10 points, effective immediately.
    The cuts take the one month rate to 6.75 pct, the two month
rate to 6.80 pct and the key three month rate to 6.85 pct, the
central bank said in a telex.
    A National Bank spokesman said the modest cut was made
after a decline in domestic money market rates yesterday, and
was not expected to be followed by a cut in the 7.60 pct
discount rate.
    The short-term treasury certificate rates, and especially
the three-month rate, have been the National Bank's main
monetary policy instrument for the last two years.
    The discount rate has been the market's penalty rate rather
than a guiding rate since 1985, and its advances are currently
little used as liquidity is ample, bank economists said.
    The bank last cut one- to three-month certificate rates on
June 5, also by 0.10 points.

<title>FRENCH STATE SELL-OFFS RAISE 52 BILLION FRANCS</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, June 17 - </dateline>The French government's privatisation
program, which began late last year, has earned the French
State about 52 billion francs to date, the Finance Ministry
said.
    Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the
revenues raised from the privatisation program would be used in
priority to pay off public debt, which stood at 398.2 billion
at the end of 1986.
    The Ministry said in a communique that the returns included
banking group Societe Generale &lt;SGEN.PA&gt;, which began its
two-week public flotation last Monday.
    The government has carried out eight flotations, as well as
the private sale of telephone group &lt;Cie Generale de
Constructions Telephoniques&gt; (CGCT) since its denationalisation
scheme began last December with the sell-off of glass makers
Saint-Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA&gt;, it added.
    The government has pledged to privatise 66 state-owned
industrial, banking and insurance companies by 1991.
    Other companies to be sold to the private sector in the
near future are television network TF-1 later this month and
banking group Cie Financiere de Suez &lt;FSPP.PA&gt; in the autumn.
    The ministry said TF-1's forthcoming sell-off meant that a
third of the government's programme would have been completed
in less than nine months.
    Balladur on Sunday rejected press and opposition charges
that the share prices for privatised companies had been pitched
too low.
    He said that the average premium of shares trading on the
Bourse was between 15 and 30 pct over their offer price. This
compared with premiums of between 60 and 80 pct on similar
share flotations in Britain.

<title>FIJI MAKES SUGAR PAYMENT TO GET HARVEST STARTED</title>
<dateline>    SUVA, June 18 - </dateline>Fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim
payment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in a
move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 crop
under way, Governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau said.
    Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop
indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record
501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December)
crop year.
    The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced
486,790 tonnes.
    For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed
harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the
Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup.
    Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make
a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for
the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers
for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills
by June 23.
    Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June
23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said.
    The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the
full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds
received to-date. The balance will be paid in October.
    Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of
23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to
the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled
Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said.
    However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of
14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the
forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane
harvested by November 30, he said.
    Ganilau said, ""This will be at least one month in advance of
the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The
balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the
end of crushing.""
    Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an
estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB)
for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off.
The FDB rejected this request.
    Ganilau said, however, ""The bank is prepared to carefully
consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of
hardship on a case-by-case basis.""
    In response to a further demand that all soldiers be
removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army
would restrict its presence in the cane areas.
    He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to
harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions
to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the
commencement of harvest.
    Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had
indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible,
he added.

    Paues said the merger was a direct result of the sharp fall
in oil prices 18 months ago which led oil firms to cut back
exploration activities. Officials said the complementary
character of the two firms' operations was a further reason.

<title>VESSEL LOST IN PACIFIC WAS CARRYING LEAD</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, June 18 - </dateline>The 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrier
Cumberlande, which sank in the South Pacific last Friday, was
carrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore,
a Lloyds Shipping Intelligence spokesman said.
    He was unable to confirm the tonnages involved.
    Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange said
the vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New South
Wales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates.
Traders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morning
trading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamental
news due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and low
stocks.
    Trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates
could convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although this
depended on the quality of the concentrates.
    A loss of this size could cause a gap in the supply
pipeline, particularly in North America, they noted. Supplies
there have been very tight this year and there is a strike at
one major producer, Cominco, and labour talks currently being
held at another, Noranda subsidiary Brunswick Mining and
Smelting Ltd.

<title>INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM PROPOSALS</title>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, June 18 - </dateline>Indonesia rejected World Bank
recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
    Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
at The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bank
for this free trade, open economy view is weak.""
    The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.
    The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
and the subsidies are a waste of money.
    Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
government would continue to maintain production targets for
""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.
    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
would save money by importing the commodity.
    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
develop and because of ""over-production and price intervention
in the developed nations.""

<title>BUDGET PACT CUTS U.S. FARM FUNDS 1.25 BILLION DLRS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </dateline>U.S. House and Senate budget
negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached
yesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending
on agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.
    The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4
billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.
    The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the
farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a
total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.
    The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture
committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in
agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets
without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior
Congressional aides told Reuters.
    Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find
the budget savings.
    Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains
subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat
and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs
and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.
    House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has
said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.
    But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to
be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and
a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said
freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major
grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget
savings Glickman claims.
    Another area where Glickman and other have said budget
savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,
ARP, levels for wheat and corn.
    However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand
within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop
wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30
pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most
commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.
    Congressional sources said the only way to achieve
significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost
the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said
singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as
unfair to one commodity.
    Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most
likely to eventually look for budget savings are some
tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible 
adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.
    Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion
but not enough, they said.
    Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture
committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on
all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price
support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.
    This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau
Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.

<title>OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS</title>
<author>    By Judith Matloff, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, June 18 - </dateline>Some OPEC states are unhappy about the
prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose
great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price
and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.
    They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference
presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances
about price differentials making some of their crudes
uncompetitive.
    There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that
OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,
to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.
    But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price
differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market
signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.
    ""All OPEC members can make a good case for changing
differentials,"" said one analyst with a major oil company. ""But
at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be ""leave well
alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.""
    Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw
sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished
customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,
marketing incentives have helped their sales.
    Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by
means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside
better priced grades in a ""package.""
    Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least
for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should
change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for
fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At
its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed
prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference
point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985
when members offered discounts to attract customers.
    OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8
mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter
and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend
or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.
    Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not
mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr
target and at most make minimal changes to differentials,
analysts say.
    The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one
non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export
crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.
Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.
    Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil
exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say
only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at
official prices, with some of the rest included in processing
or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.
    Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,
when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to
pay the new prices.
   Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude
-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --
was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.
    In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below
its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,
due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has
risen.
    Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say
its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.
    But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort
Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the
differentials question in Vienna.
    ""It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which
holds the presidency, raised the issue,"" he said.

<title>NEW ZEALAND BUDGET FORECAST SEEN AS POSITIVE</title>
<dateline>    WELLINGTON, June 18 - </dateline>Analysts said they were surprised at
the government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for
fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy
statements and positive for the economy.
    Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus
for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs
against a 1.95 billion deficit last year.
    Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus
was even more positive than the most bullish analysts'
forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.
    Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters
before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a
2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.
    The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and
the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically,
the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite
lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more
confident about investing in New Zealand, he said.
    However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying
the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will
move lower.
    The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after
hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget
release.
    Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share
market, despite an increase in the contribution of company
taxation to revenue figures.
    One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus
announcement could push the share market up by 50 points
tomorrow.
    The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a
continuation of existing policies, and the absence of
traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively
by overseas investors, another said.
    But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax
avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share
market, particularly multi-national companies.
    The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,
through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The
requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln
N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.
    Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and
there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another
economist said. He added that the document seemed entirely
credible.
    ""Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects,""
he said.
    An election is due before the end of September.

<title>INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM IDEAS</title>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, June 18 - </dateline>Indonesia rejected World Bank
recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
    Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
at The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bank
for this free trade, open economy view is weak.""
    The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
growth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.
    The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
and the subsidies are a waste of money.
    Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
government would continue to maintain production targets for
""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.
    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
would save money by importing the commodity.
    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
develop and because of ""over-production and price intervention
in the developed nations.""

<title>U.K. DATA DEPRESS RATE CUT OUTLOOK - ANALYSTS</title>
<author>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, June 18 - </dateline>Today's U.K. Economic data have pushed
the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current
nine pct further into the distance, analysts said.
    A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing
production data showed that the economy is still strong and
does not need a fillip from lower rates.
    News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,
taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money
supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist
arguments against easier credit, they said.
    ""The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back
all the while. The strength of the economy and broad money
growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near
term,"" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.
    Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's
mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies
said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.
Rates.
    It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that
a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such
optimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which
mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's
strength.
    The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm
about May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly
replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying
average earnings in April, dealers said.
    The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending
rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank
of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset
the impact on domestic money supply of its current
intervention.
    ""The gilt market reaction was correct,"" said Bill Martin,
chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.
    ""That's very important ... It shows the economy in a very
good state indeed,"" Skeoch said.
    ""There's no reason to get worries about inflationary
pressures because they're very subdued."" Unit wage cost rises
were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to
April, and it was these costs rather than average earnings
which were potentially inflationary, he added.
    ""I don't think these average earnings numbers are a major
problem,"" agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.
    But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried
about the funding implications of recent intervention.
    He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets
earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that
the ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, now
looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try
to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.
    However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson
Securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still
trigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal
higher inflation this year.
    ""Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As
long as that continues we're okay,"" he added.

<title>ARCO &lt;ARC&gt; SPIN-OFF SEEN AT 500 MLN DLRS</title>
<author>    By Samuel Fromartz, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </dateline>Atlantic Richfield Co, considering a
spin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, could
gain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analysts
estimated.
    Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points on
rumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based on
about 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy was
valuing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said.
    Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statement
around mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct of
the unit, leading investors to take profits.
    After the announcement, the company's stock retreated,
closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4.
    ""It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhat
disappointing,"" said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. He
said rumors of the spin-off had been around ""for a couple of
days.""
    Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn't
getting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and its
value was not reflected in the company's stock price.
    Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein said
the unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and
he expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year.
    Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena says
chemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth about
three billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500
to 600 mln dlrs.
    Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake
because chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated the
company would use the proceeds to pay down debt.
    But he added the possibility remained the deal would fall
through. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet been
presented to its board.
    The chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billion
dlrs.

<title>U.K. COURT RULES AGAINST RTZ ON OIL FIELD COSTS</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, June 18 - </dateline>The U.K. High Court dismissed an appeal
by Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc's &lt;RTZL.L&gt; RTZ Oil and Gas Ltd unit
and ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for the
future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible,
the Press Association reported.
    The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax
Commissioners that any such provision was a capital
expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible.
The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an
annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of
abandoning a rig.
    An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the
subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible
from corporation tax payable.
    It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all
budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he
said.
    Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability was
shared by the industry as a whole.
    The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the
expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the
expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were
built into the accounts, one analyst added.

<title>EUROPEAN COMMUNITY CRITICISES U.S TRADE MEASURES</title>
<dateline>    GENEVA, June 18 - </dateline>The European Community (EC) accused the
United States of violating a political commitment to free trade
through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a
customs user fee.
    EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the
surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters.
    Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in
criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which
import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to
improve its balance of payments.
    The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules
by restricting imports of agricultural products through an
import licensing system. The United States asked for
consultations with Tokyo on the issue.
    Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a
political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers,
pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.
    When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to
negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT
surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT
jargon as ""standstill and rollback.""
    Tran criticised Washington for the ""superfund"" tax on oil
imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special
machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government
procurement list for reasons of national security.
    Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the
policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.
    The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks
to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round,
to decide any further action on the charges.
    The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the
subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the
Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.
    The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's
report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports
breached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its
legislation.
    Mexico and Canada, along with the European Community,
brought the dispute to the GATT last year.

<title>U.S. SAID UNFAIRLY PROTECTING DEFENSE INDUSTRY</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, June 18 - </dateline>Britain's Defence Minister George Younger
said the U.S. Was unfairly protecting its defence industry, and
this could lead to British firms demanding counter-measures.
    Younger told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce meeting that U.S.
Legislators were failing to realise ""the true nature of the
two-way street in terms of ideas, technology and equipment.
    A British parliamentary report said that up to March
British firms had been awarded just 34 mln dlrs worth of
contracts for the Strategic Defence Initiative, compared with
the 1.5 billion dlrs Britain had hoped to secure.
    The committee said U.S. Technology export restrictions and
""selectiveness"" towards foreign contractors had denied British
competitors more lucrative orders and largely excluded them
from technological research for SDI.
    Younger said London had given U.S. Companies contracts
under conditions of fair and open competition. ""All we ask is
for our companies to be given similar opportunities,"" he added.
    If new American legislation aimed at curbing unfair
subsidies was used to exclude foreign suppliers it would not be
surprising if British firms pressed for retaliatory measures,
Younger said.

<title>GILLETTE &lt;GS&gt; SEEN OBJECT OF GLOBAL BIDDING WAR</title>
<author>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </dateline>Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon Group
Inc &lt;REV&gt;, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for Gillette
Co that could draw some big international players and in the
process make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analysts
said.
    Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of
directors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested
consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per
share. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in
November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.
    ""I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and
more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands
to make a ton of money,"" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc. ""In play"" is a term used on Wall Street to
describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling
takeover target.
    Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon
gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through
November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per
share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of
three yesterday.
    The agreement would be calculated on the basis of
Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a
split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other
company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262
mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen
returned telephone calls seeking comment.
    ""Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if
someone else takes over Gillette,"" said Analyst Deepak Raj of
Merrill Lynch and Co. ""I'm not saying that is going to happen
but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45
dlrs per share.""
    Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons
why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring
Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon
private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two
years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's
operations. ""He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of
the dearptment store business."" Another reason is that Revlon
has recently made two other acquisitions.
    Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if
some company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS&gt; or Procter and Gamble
Co &lt;PG&gt; decided to take a look at Gillette.
    Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for
Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN&gt;,
RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR&gt;, American Brands Inc &lt;AMB&gt; and Ralston
Purina Co &lt;RAL&gt;.
    ""Perelman is trying to put the company in play,"" said a
Wall Street arbitrageur. ""He gets to share in the upside if the
company is sold."" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette
to resist Perelman's overture. ""I can't see the board
consenting, what has changed between November and now,"" he
said.
   
    Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.
""Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of
calculation,"" he said. But he added, ""The Gillette board has to
be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by
shareholders."" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,
three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.
    According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by
Gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger
agreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank
N.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial
adviser.

<title>SENATOR DEFENDS U.S. MANDATORY FARM CONTROL BILL</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </dateline>Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his
controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S.
farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they
approve of the proposal.
    The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per
bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for
soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on
planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs
for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.
    Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market
sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting
nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the
first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings
examining farm programs.
    Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his
""Family Farm Act.""
    -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income
and reduce government spending on agriculture.
    -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not
ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would
increase overall revenue from exports.
    This would be done by seeking agreement among major
exporting countries including the European Community on market
sharing at agreed high prices.
    Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing
that such a grain export cartel is not workable.
    -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports
would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices
stem more from ""gouging"" by food processing companies than from
high farm product prices.
    Harkin cited what he termed ""excessive"" net returns on
equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct
Monfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J.
Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct
Quaker Oats.
    -- Harkin said a ""legitimate"" concern about his bill would
be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.
    He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would
allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.
grain stocks for three years.
    Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a
""predictable and stable"" grain price, he said.
    -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm
participation would be no more ""mandatory"" than the current
farm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm
programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect
farm income.

<title>JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS WILL GROW AGAIN IN 1987, OECD</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, June 18 - </dateline>Japan's trade surplus is likely to
continue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad
increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
said.
    In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the
OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last
year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while
export markets rose by only two pct.
    But it said this differential between the growth of
domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,
""thus weakening the international adjustment process.""
    It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two
pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct
in 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will
rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in
1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.
    The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion
yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand
and increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the
measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite
possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have
worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.
    The OECD outlook said, ""Continued large current account
surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial
net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure
on the yen."" It said that further appreciation could then lead
manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus
weaken domestic growth.
    The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to
gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct
growth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance
on inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a
0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.

<title>U.S.-CANADA TIES SEEN WORSE WITHOUT TRADE PACT</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </dateline>U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen if
the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact,
according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy
research groups.
    The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute
of Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross
border trade would benefit both countries.
    But Cato chairman William Niskanen added ""the two nations'
generally harmonious trade relations are probably not
sustainable without a new agreement.""
    The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade
totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding
talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers
remaining between their two countries.
    The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both
sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining
remained.
    Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties
could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on
President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and
this could hit some Canadian trade practices.
    He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto
industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral
free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.
    Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to
a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S.
exports to Canada.
    A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and
enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which
would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.
    It would also increase the gross national products of both
countries.
    Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all
tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules
for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government
procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.

<title>SQUIBB &lt;SQB&gt; SAID NOT INTERESTED IN BUYING CETUS</title>
<author>    BY MARJORIE SHAFFER, REUTERS</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </dateline>Robert Fildes, president and chief
executive of Cetus Corp &lt;CTUS.O&gt;, told Reuters that Squibb Corp
is not interested in buying Cetus.
    Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a
five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs.
    ""This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major
majority holder in Cetus,"" Fildes told Reuters in an interview.
""Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they
want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind
of arrangement,"" said Fildes.
    Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments
by Fildes.
    Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only
one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK&gt;
and W.R. Grace &lt;WR&gt; both have joint ventures with Cetus, but
neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes.
    Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic
products and with Grace to develop agricultural products.
    Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement 
an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop
new biotechnology products in several fields.
   
    As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus'
anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.
Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but
not in North American and Western Europe.
    ""We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood
that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in
North America and Europe,"" said Fildes.
    He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a
major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its
own in that market.
   
    Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with
pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own
business. Many large corporations have invested in small
biotech firms.
    But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made
in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus
because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship
with a large number of other biotechnology companies.""
   
    Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug
areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to ""keep the
biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves.""
    Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to
broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas
as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory
markets.
    Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research
over the next five years.
   
    ""Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and
development to make it happen, while the equity position part
of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this
partnership,"" said Fildes.

<title>FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY</title>
<author>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </dateline>New U.S. Banking data suggest the
Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path
and is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists
said.
    But they also said that if money supply growth remains
weak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline
suggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its
credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary
policy.
    A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a
forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June
8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a
decline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs
to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.
    Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for
the week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has
fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,
economists said.
    ""M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,"" said Bill Sullivan
of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
    While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of
economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned
the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth
in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen
as better gauges of economic growth.
    Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both
measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's
5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.
    If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,
concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,
could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.
    ""Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open
market position? No,"" Sullivan said. ""But does this mean the end
of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes.""
    Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings
of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period
were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had
targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.
    But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day
net miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher
borrowings target would probably have been reached.
    A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in
auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,
while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has
helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.
    ""If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed
easing at some point,"" he said.
    Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little
attention to weak money supply growth. ""It has been a number of
years since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the
economy,"" one said. ""I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is
falling apart and the Fed should ease.""
    Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a
prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary
policy.
    They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates
for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and
higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke
off econmomic growth.
    But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late
April. ""The Fed has to determine if this represents a
fundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives
them more room to ease,"" he said.

<title>TAIWAN DOLLAR AND RESERVES SEEN RISING MORE SLOWLY</title>
<author>    By Chen Chien-Kuo, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TAIPEI, June 19 - </dateline>Recent government moves to curb capital
inflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan's
foreign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollar
against the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said.
    Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the
reserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past two
weeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against the
U.S. Dollar.
    Chang said, ""The pace of increase in our reserves is much
slower now than before and our currency is getting more stable.""
He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surplus
with the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S.
Dlrs a month between January and May.
    The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and
West Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs.
    On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings of
local and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bank
purchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90
pct of the value of a contract.
    Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures had
drastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange to
importers and exporters.
    They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollar
transactions showed a drastic decline with some banks
registering a fall of up to 30 pct.
    Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised against
the U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanese
cents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of five
to eight cents in May.
    The bank dealers said the central bank, which had
previously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1
billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercial
demand.
    They said they expected the government to keep the local
dollar stable in the near term to give breathing space to
businesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise of
more than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar since
September 1985.
    The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today,
unchanged from yesterday.
    Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said,
""It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflow
is quite successful.""
    Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slower
rise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure from
Washington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan.
    Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayed
imports of machinery and production equipment because of
exchange rate uncertainty, he said. The stable exchange rate
would help boost imports, particularly from the United States.

<dateline>    LONDON, June 19 - </dateline>J Sainsbury Plc&lt;SNB.L&gt; said it agreed to
take control of the U.S. Shaw's Supermarkets Inc through a
combination of share purchases and a tender offer at 30 dlrs a

    Sainsbury bought about 21 pct of the stock in 1983. It said
its U.S. Subsidiary, Chene Investments Inc, bought 2.55 mln
common shares from the controlling Davis family yesterday at 30
dlrs a share for 76.5 mln dlrs, lifting its stake to 49.4 pct.
    A tender offer for the outstanding shares will be launched,
also at 30 dlrs a share for a maximum further cost of 184.4
mln.
    The Shaw's Board and the Davis family has agreed to accept
the offer, thus assuring Sainsbury's a total holding of 74.0
pct.
    The company had allotted 20.18 mln new ordinary shares to
&lt;Warburg Securities Ltd&gt; which it said would be sufficient to
finance about 188 mln dlrs of the maximum 261 mln dlrs payable.
    Shaw's operates a chain of 49 supermarkets in
Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire which in 1986 produced
sales of 1.1 billiob dlrs and pretax profit of 31.1 mln. At the
end of 1986 it had net assets of 88 mln dlrs.
    Last September, Sainsbury's increased its stake in Shaw's

pretax profit to 246.9 mln stg from 192.7 mln on sales that
increased to 4.04 billion from 3.58 billion.

    Kondo said after a cabinet meeting that consumers should
receive the benefits of the falling costs of rice farming due
to the strong yen and lower oil prices.
    Agriculture Ministry sources said the producer rice price
paid to rice farmers would be cut after discussions by the Rice
Price Council, an advisory body to the ministry, on July 1 and
2. The consumer rice price is usually set in December.

<title>JAPAN PANEL URGES WORLD ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENTS</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, June 19 - </dateline>Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the
value of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. And
other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, an
advisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency
(EPA) said.
    The advisory body said in its report that the yen would
soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global
basis were delayed.
    An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall to
slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed to
restructure their economies.
    The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut
Japan's current account surplus to two pct of gross national
product (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a change
would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually
during the seven-year period to 1993.
    If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar
would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan's
current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. This
scenario put Japan's GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.
    It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy
and four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.

<title>JAPAN MUST TRY HARDER TO CUT SURPLUS - MINISTER</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, June 19 - </dateline>Japan must try harder to reduce its trade
surplus or the yen will come under renewed upward pressure,
Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo.
    He told a press luncheon he hoped Japan could cut its
current account surplus by some 10 billion dlrs a year until it
is reduced to some 50 to 60 billion dlrs. In the fiscal year
ended March 31 the surplus totalled 93.76 billion dlrs, or
about 4.5 pct of GNP.
    The 6,000 billion yen economic stimulation package the
government unveiled late last month would help slash Japan's
current account surplus by five to six billion dlrs, he said.

<title>SRI LANKA PLANS TO RENEW ABU DHABI OIL CONTRACT</title>
<dateline>    COLOMBO, June 19 - </dateline>Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC) has decided
to renew its one-year contract with Abu Dhabi for 480,000
tonnes of Upper Zakum crude oil, CPC officials told Reuters.
    They said CPC made the recommendation to the cabinet and is
now awaiting its approval.
    CPC's one-year contract with Abu Dhabi expired on May 31
this year and it wants the renewed contract to begin on June 1
at the government selling price. Delivery will be determined in
the course of the year. Last year, shipments were in three
parcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each.
    CPC officials also said the company agreed with the
Egyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of Gulf of
Suez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the
government selling price.
    Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through
C.Itoh.
    Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Light
from Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several
constraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels
and proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments.
    Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where
lifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC
then proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each.
    CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for
delivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to
offload CPC's needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable.
    CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since
December. Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln

<title>SAUDI OIL RESERVES RISE DESPITE HIGHER OUTPUT</title>
<dateline>    JEDDAH, June 19 - </dateline>Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi
Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according
to the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco.
    Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167
billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985,
while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft
from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said.
    Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about
200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per
day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.

    Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as
OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture
their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed
from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the
organisation decided to cut production again from last
September onwards.
    Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.
    Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly
to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the
official Saudi Press Agency.
    The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the
number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.

    Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44
mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was
upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling
it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the
report said.
    The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by
another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced
around 750,000 bpd last year.

    Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from
998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began
operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes
per day, the report said.
    Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4
billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs.

    The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, follows
government concern over ""lower than average rainfall in southern
Ghana and its implications for the major harvest.""

areas throughout the south this year. The Ministry of
Agriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in all
major staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.
    GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequences
of current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought
experiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps to
alleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.
    The failure of seasonal rains has already seriously

Leigh-Pemberton said lowering interest rates too fast could
jeopardise recent economic achievements in the U.K.
    In remarks prepared for delivery to businessmen in
Birmingham, he said prospective returns on real investment are
more favourable, relative to those on financial assets, than
for a good number of years.
    ""It would surely be foolish to put that favourable
conjuncture at risk by lowering interest rates prematurely or
excessively,"" he said.
    ""We might enjoy a short-term boost to activity, but at the
risk of a damaging return to the uncertainty and acrimony of
high inflation,"" he added.
    Leigh-Pemberton said he recognised there are some who would
argue that interest rates are still too high and deter
investment in industry.
    ""But we should not forget that less than a year ago we were
intervening to support sterling and had some temporary
difficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase in
base rates, to 11 pct, was a sufficient tightening of policy at
the time,"" he added. Base rate is currently nine pct.

<title>FAILURE OF EC FARM PRICE TALKS DISRUPTS TENDERS</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, June 19 - </dateline>There will be no serious bids at European
Community open market tenders for wheat and barley until EC
farm ministers agree to the 1987/88 farm price package, trade
sources said.
    The failure of farm ministers this week to come to an
agreement resulted in no bids at this week's tender for export
subsidies and traders said bids are unlikely as long as the
uncertainty remains.
    One trader said permanent damage to export prospects can be
avoided if an agreemend can be reached soon, but the situation
will become more serious as time passes.
    However, traders said there seem to be few buyers around,
lessening the disruptive impact of the delay.
    Poland and South Korea, who are in the market for feed
wheat, will be offered intervention grain through special
tenders, traders said.

<title>U.K. LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES</title>
<author>    By Norma Cohen, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, June 19 - </dateline>More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers
fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes
the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other
interest rates.
    And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in
years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers
trying to lock into cheap money.
    The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials
said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home
mortgage business.
    While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They
were the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a
few years ago.
    But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,
mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low
as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their
portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to
induce them to retain their accounts.
    As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were
forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose
rates would move in line with the cost of funds.
    ""We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,""
said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,
explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only
offering variable rate mortgages.
    The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped
homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders
concede they are being forced to undercut each other still
more.
    Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier
this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by
National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for
new business, officials at all three institutions said.
    The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even
below those on the variable rate loans.
    ""Of course they are less profitable than other (variable
rate) mortgages,"" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which
earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate
new mortgage loans.
    But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable
loans because, ""It was just another way to attract people to our
mortgage product.""
    Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed
rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.
    The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was
exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.
    ""Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,"" she said, noting
that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct
of its 1986 volume.
    In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they
offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest
rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the
lender is earning an above average return on assets.
    But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won
the benefit of cheap money.
    Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed
rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption
that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates
fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.
    Young explained that the company had planned to protect
itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a
complicated hedging instrument.
    But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations
and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He
said money market rates were too high to arrange both the
mortgages and hedge profitably.
    However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does
make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This
means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond
and selling them to an investor.
    For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more
efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate
mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular
again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money
over the past few years.

<title>HARCOURT &lt;HBJ&gt; MUM ON REED &lt;REED.L&gt; RUMORS</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </dateline>Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc officials
were not available for comment on market rumors that it is
interested in acquiring Reed International plc &lt;REED.L&gt;.
    Officials of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial
adviser, declined comment.
    A Wall Street arbitrageur, who owns Harcourt shares, said
the rumors did not make much sense because Harcourt has
announced a recapitalization plan to ward off a takeover
attempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell.""It's completely
inconsistent with the recapitalization, the only way is if they
drop the recapitalization,"" he said.
    Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned.
    Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of a
U.S. Court in Orlando, Fla. Monday. The company has sought a
declaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011
in light of the recapitalization.
    Harcourt said in a statement this week that Salomon
Brothers Inc &lt;SB&gt; and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in the
case, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amount
of the debenture. In addition, British Printing and
Communications Corp, headed by Maxwell, owns 9.5 mln dlrs face
amount, Harcourt said.
    Salomon said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures. If the
court decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr,
they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares.
    Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is not
required to issue common to debenture holders who did not
convert prior to June eight.
    An increase in Reed shares in London today was attributed
by brokers to rumors of Harcourt's interest and also to rumors
that Maxwell might be a buyer. But an adviser to Maxwell in New
York said ""there's no basis to think that it's us.""

<title>COLD, WET WEATHER SLOWS BEET GROWTH IN W. EUROPE</title>

western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet
growth but plant density is reported to be good in most
countries, sugar statistician F.O. Licht said.
    Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has
hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged
fields.
    But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather has
boosted sugar beet growth.
    Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet
development, Licht said.
    In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plant
population is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainy
weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are
rated as slightly below normal.
    In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with
heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.
    In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it
was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which
continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work
impossible.
    In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was
favourable for beet growth, Licht said.
    In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring
beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.
    In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union,
it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was
generally good for the emergence and growth of beets.
    In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfall
boosted beet development.
    Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputes

<title>U.S. OIL PRICES STRONG AHEAD OF OPEC MEETING</title>
<author>    By SUSAN SHERER, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </dateline>U.S. crude oil prices are at their
highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC
meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any
policy changes from the session.
    They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the
organization's accord in December, have risen on technical
factors within the market and concerns about supplies because
of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the
Gulf.
    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading
around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile
Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its
highest level since January 1986.
    OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's
oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to
be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production
agreement may only need a slight review.
    Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation
of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to
a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.
    Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon
after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased
tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices
should begin easing.
    ""OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed
to in December because oil prices are firm,"" said John Hill, a
vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.
    OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at
18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to
16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln
barrels in the fourth quarter.
    This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising
from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.
    Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,
Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a
reduction in output.
    ""And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to
trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that
OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,"" said Nauman
Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.
    But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such
as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.
    ""The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the
official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are
committed to stabilizing the market,"" said Rosario Ilacqua,
analyst with L.F. Rothschild.
    However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting
in September to re-evaluate market conditions.
    Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the
fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a
day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000
barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president
of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.
    Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this
meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to
offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated
throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,
producers receive less money for their oil.
    ""The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,""
said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.
    ""In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to
produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act
as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two
dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,"" he
said.
    One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.
    ""The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian
Gulf,"" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securites.
    Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been
regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration
is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the
U.S. flag, with naval escorts.
    ""Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis
like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that
could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,"" Knuettel said.

Treasury Department that it will not include fluidized bed
combustion technology, a method for the more efficient burning

due to high costs.
    Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic

the oil shale plant. In return the company would have been
eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports

from the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.
    Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized

compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.
    The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and

    Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment
tax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project

Revlon must have the permission of Gillette's board before
making an offer to shareholders. The board declined to grant
that permission.
   
    Gillette has been the topic of takeover speculation for
several weeks. Its stock has traded heavily, and arbitragers
said they believe Jacobs may not be the only investor who has a
sizeable position in the company.

<title>LATIN, CARIBBEAN NATIONS OPPOSE TRADE BILLS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </dateline>A group of Latin American and
Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in
Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development
and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.
    Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of
American States special committee on trade, said he was aware
of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added ""the region should
not be the one affected by the trade bills.""
    He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar
and the budget deficit, and ""it is regrettable to solve it by a
trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests.""
    Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two
days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in
Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit,
which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.
    Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at
Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large,
annual trade surpluses with the United States.
    Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations
with large trade surpluses last year with the United States,
but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2
billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs.
    The European Community has also opposed the bills.
    Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the
Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in
the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require
retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.
    He told reporters the committee would likely mount a
campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate
on the Senate floor, expected next week.
    Rodriguez said ""the region needs trade to continue
development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively
by trade legislation.""
    Rodriguez said: ""we need to keep the market opens -
especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign
exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue
national development progress.""
    President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he
termed ""protectionist,"" and his aides now are mounting a effort
to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the
legislation.
    Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez
said as yet ""the administration is not in a veto frame of mind.""

<title>REED INTL DENIES BID APPROACH</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, June 19 - </dateline>Reed International Plc &lt;REED.L&gt; denied
rumours on the U.K. Stock market that it was the target of a
takeover bid and said it had received no approach.
    ""In view of the increase in our share price today, I want to
make clear that we have not received any bid approaches,"" Reed's

    Rumours that U.S. Publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc

Reed shares up 54p at 600p at one stage today before they eased
back to 564p at the close against a background of a widespread

    Share market analysts said speculators were buying the
stock on belief that Harcourt would bid for Reed in an effort
to escape the unwelcome two billion dlr bid from Robert
Maxwell's British Printing and Communication Corp &lt;BPCL.L&gt;.
    Such a move would have made Harcourt too big for BPCC to
take it over, analysts added.
    They also said there was some speculation that if BPCC's

<title>KUWAIT SEEN WANTING TO LEASE SOME U.S. TANKERS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </dateline>The United States said Kuwait was
discussing plans to lease privately-owned U.S. tankers to
transport oil through the Gulf in addition to putting some of
its own vessels under American flags.
    State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, who made the
disclosure about the tankers, also told reporters the United
States expects to conclude very soon a favorable arrangement
with Saudi Arabia concerning expanded security cooperation in
the Gulf. The two developments occur as the Reagan
administration continued to come under fire in Congress for its
plans to bring 11 Kuwaiti tankers under American flags.
    The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranian
attacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategic
waterway but has raised fears on Capitol Hill that it will draw
the United States into the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War.
    ""The Kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of chartering
U.S. flag vessels with the Maritime Administration,"" Oakley
said. She emphasized, however, that ""if some charter arrangement
could be worked out, it would not supplant the reflagging
arrangement that we worked out with the Kuwaitis.""
    In both cases, the ships would be eligible for U.S. Navy
escort in the Gulf, she said.

   The Washington Post today quoted John Gaughan, administrator
of the Martime Administration, as saying Kuwait has approached
an American shipping company about the possibility of a
charter.
    Gaughan said that earlier this week he told representatives
of the company, whose identify he did not know, that chartered
vessels flying the U.S. flag ""would be protected,"" the newspaper
reported.
    Concerning Saudi Arabia, Oakley said ""we are moving forward
in our talks ... on how we can tailor our efforts and security
cooperation to facilitate our Gulf operations.""

<title>NEW LEADER COMING TO U.S. SEC IN CHALLENGING ERA</title>
<author>    By Irwin Arieff, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </dateline>President Reagan's nominee as top
policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an
agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock
price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the
globalization of financial markets.
    David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at
Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday
to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.
    If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed
John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record
six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.
    The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its
investigators have probed into the most colossal insider
trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.
    The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in
recent months as a growing number of well known traders and
prominent investment banking firms have been charged with
wrongdoing.
    The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after
Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock
speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators
and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal
profits after being charged with insider trading.
    But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new
phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by
computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in 
securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have
combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented
volatility to some U.S. securities markets.
    At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some
lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate
takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers
steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.
    And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign
exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork
for an international securities marketplace in which trading
occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.
    Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment
opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce
U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.
    Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial
disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,
eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to
spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's
review of hostile corporate takeovers.
    Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton
investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to
the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.
    In line with the views of other top administration
officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover
battles over new federal regulations.
    The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider
trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that
topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the
administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.
    Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with
Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to
significantly alter the commission's current priorities.
    The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them
lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that
figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the
agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.
    The agency is one of the few in the government that
actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past
few years because of fees it charges public companies,
investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.
    The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,
meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the
president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing
for policy differences alone.
    By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same
political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request
each year instead of leaving this to the White House.
    Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins
to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed
in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted
market manipulations by large investment firms.
    The agency requires public companies and investment
vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on
their financial condition and to disclose changes in their
condition any time they issue new securities.
    It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to
register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and
it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.
    Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial
magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to
become the nation's 35th president.
    Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served
from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in
1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's
first term and was Reagan's director of the Central
Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.

<title>U.S. ASKS CONGRESS TO REVISE TARIFF CATEGORIES</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </dateline>The Administration asked Congress to
replace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it
into line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter said.
    The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more
accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when
the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.
    Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is
called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet
the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they
should pay about the same rates of duties.
    Yeutter said, ""American exporters will find it far easier to
deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of
differing systems which they now face.""
    He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational
negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.
    Yeutter said government and business moves are based on
data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve
knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.
    He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under
the new system, with about half expected to join the system by
January 1988.

<title>ITALY DEFICIT NOT DUE TO LIBERALIZATION-MINISTER</title>
<dateline>    ROME, June 19 - </dateline>Italy's Foreign Trade Minister Mario
Sarcinelli, commenting on speculation in the Italian press,
said a sharp balance of payments deficit in May could not be
attributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreign
securities.
    Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month's
overall 3,211 billion lire deficit, which compares with April's
2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a May 13 decree
abolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreign
securities purchases.
   ""The deficit can be better attributed to premature and
delayed foreign trade payments and receipts (leads and lags)
rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment,"" Sarcinelli
said in a statement.
    Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks by
the Bank of Italy, which announced the deficit for May and said
it had been partly caused by ""non-banking capital outflows.""
    ""In practice, it seems that there has been a constant flow
of capital to foreign securities or investments outside our
borders,"" said the newspaper.
    But the newspaper added that it was still not possible to
say how far the move to abolish foreign securities purchase
deposits had affected Italy's balance of payments.

<title>UPTREND REMAINS INTACT FOR DEBT FUTURES</title>
<author>    by Patricia Campbell, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, June 19 - </dateline>The six basis point rise of the past
month in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a
series of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the
dollar holds firm.
    ""Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis
points over the last month, largely over indications that
inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing
U.S. trade balance, in nominal terms,"" Samuel Kahan, chief
financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government
Securities, said.
    Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in
the economy during the first quarter, but his concern is
whether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the
longer term.
    Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has
become more important to the direction of debt futures than the
beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.
    The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer
Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down
1.5 pct, respectively.
    Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money
supply announced this week was ""surprising, much larger than
expected,"" according to Kahan. ""Unless quickly reversed,"" such
a trend ""will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,""
Kahan said.
    Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which
Kahan said have ""slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board
annual targets,"" the consequences could be a hint of economic
weakness down the road, he said.
    Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for
further gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,
analysts said.
    September T-bonds ""are up almost six points since about May
18,"" Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September
bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93
in mid-June, Duggan said.
    While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,
and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through
chart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted
above the 93 level.
    ""The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken
out before this activity is anything other than a trading range
market,"" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst
Brian Singer said.
    The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.
currency has made little headway of late, analysts said.
    ""The critical variable remaining in the market is the value
of the dollar,"" Kahan said.
    Additional influences next week will be possible
developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact
and size of the U.S. budget deficit, ""although these will not
be in the forefront of the market early next week,"" Kahan said.
    In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding
auctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results
with little excitement. However, a successful auction could
prove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market
psychology.

<title>OIL MARKETS SHOW RESPECT FOR NEW OPEC ACCORD</title>
<dateline>    SINGAPORE, June 29 - </dateline>OPEC has shown itself to be in control
of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a
pact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day
(bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said.
    They said market respect for the cartel has increased since
it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output
to 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December.
    ""There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensured
there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is in
effect putting pressure on end-users,"" a European crude oil
trader said.
    In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, ""There's no reason to expect
a weak market from now on.""
    A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, ""We
thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter
production so the market will react very bullishly.""
    Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a
slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmark
crude, they expect price increases over the next few days.
    August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at
around 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but still
below the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.
    Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and Abu
Dhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak
positions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traders
said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least.
    They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to
stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.
    They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected
and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter
requirements before October.
    Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on
European and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.
    ""There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production
by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high,"" said an
international trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was less
bullish, ""For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on
how much they (OPEC members) cheat.""
    A Singapore trade source said, ""There is enough cheating and
leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is
no need to worry about shortages.""
    Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level,
after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearish
factor to be considered.
    Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as
possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market
cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.
    Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in
thin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillates
quiet on minimal buying interest.
    Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and
tight prompt supplies, dealers said.

<title>FAR EAST TRADERS EXPECT 20 DLR OIL IN JANUARY</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, June 29 - </dateline>OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6
mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost
spot prices and enable the group to raise its official
reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current
18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.
    ""Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the
official price will be 20 dlrs in January,"" a Japanese refiner
said.
    The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC
members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and
Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.
    Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as
the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987
output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs
for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for
U.K. Brent, traders said.
    They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into
the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate
(WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.
    ""With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import
Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those
grades further,"" said a Japanese oil trader.
    Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot
market has further upward potential in the short term, having
risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.
    ""You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that
basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today,"" said
one international oil trader in Tokyo.
    ""But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought
back up again pretty quickly,"" he added.
    One oil industry analyst concurred, ""There is no reason to
expect a weak market from now on."" He said he expected OPEC to
raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.
    Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly
in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and
the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to
maintain steady prices.
    Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day
compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its
export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline
through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.
    Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,
against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up
to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.
    Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating
on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price
discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But
they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as
swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher
output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise
too high too fast.
    Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln
barrels. ""Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the
stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises
too much,"" an oil industry analyst said.

<title>FAR EAST TRADERS EXPECT 20 DLR OIL IN JANUARY</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, June 29 - </dateline>OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6
mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost
spot prices and enable the group to raise its official
reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current
18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.
    ""Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the
official price will be 20 dlrs in January,"" a Japanese refiner
said.
    The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC
members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and
Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.
    Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as
the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987
output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs
for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for
U.K. Brent, traders said.
    They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into
the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate
(WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.
    ""With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import
Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those
grades further,"" said a Japanese oil trader.
    Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot
market has further upward potential in the short term, having
risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.
    ""You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that

<title>SAUDI OIL COMPANY GETS NEW ACTING GOVERNOR</title>
<dateline>    RIYADH, June 29 - </dateline>The acting governor of Saudi Arabia's
state-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, has
retired at his own request, oil industry sources said.
    They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation
planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.
    Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher,
left in a major oil industry shake up last December.
    The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the
post permanently.
    The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki
Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry
sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil
market.
    The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20
years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi
Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned
to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.
    Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an
OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel
last December.
    Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations
which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia
does business, the sources said.
    The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's
job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who
earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of
Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister
Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the

<title>NORWAY EXTENDS 7.5 PCT OIL OUTPUT CUT - MINISTRY</title>
<dateline>    OSLO, June 29 - </dateline>Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in
planned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15
until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle
told Reuters.
    ""We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,""
he said. ""The accord reached there means stability in the oil
market and we shall continue making our contribution.""
    The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would
probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle
said. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and
would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.
    OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of
16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and
retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord
based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.
    OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and
it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter
ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth
quarter.
    Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore
fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from
planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained
within its December accord on output and prices.
    Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around
840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln
bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.
    The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since
February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.
    Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for
a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement
on the latest oil production cutbacks.
    Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC
producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia
and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep
prices stable.
    Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an
OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around
18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.
    Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export
earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price
during the first half of 1986.
    But firmer oil prices since then have brought some
stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade
deficit.
     Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently
refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to
the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.

<title>BANK OF JAPAN DETERMINED TO KEEP EASY MONEY POLICY</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, June 29 - </dateline>The Bank of Japan bought 100 billion yen
in certificates of deposit (CDs) via repurchase agreements
today to show its determination to maintain an easy money
policy, central bank officials said.
    ""Today's CD buying operation was designed to seek an
announcement effect, in which we would reassure the market of
the fact that we have not changed our policy stance,"" a senior
central bank official told Reuters.
    The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-month
commercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in the
interbank market today, the officials said.
    The central bank was concerned about growing market
expectations of higher interest rates, which were in part
responsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices,
the officials said.
    But money traders said the market generally shrugged off
the bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate far
below prevailing market rates. The rate on the key three-month
CDs in the primary market was 4.08/00 pct, while the bank's bid
was 3.75 pct, they said.
    The bank's bill buying operation also had little impact
because it was regarded as a routine operation, they said.
    The money traders said they regarded the central bank's CD
buying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan's
pledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy.
    ""We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip
any further,"" a bank manager said, adding that the prevailing
market expectation of higher rates will remain.
    ""If this is the case, the three-month CD rate will stay
above four pct for the time being,"" he said.

<title>BANGLADESH'S TRADE GAP TO WIDEN IN 1987/88</title>
<dateline>    DHAKA, June 28 - </dateline>Bangladesh's trade gap is expected to
widen in fiscal 1987/88 beginning on July 1 after the
government relaxed restrictions on some imports including
luxury cars.
    The country has set its export target for the year at 1.1
billion U.S. Dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs,
compared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and
1.113 billion dlrs of imports.
    Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changes
were aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boost
foreign exchange earnings and imports of essential machinery
and raw materials, to increase industrial production.
    The government was easing procedures to enhance incentives
especially for exporters of textiles and frozen food and
importers of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim told
reporters.
    Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policy
covered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billion
dlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by the
government were not included in the policy, they added.
    They said the country's total import bill (both commercial
and other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs in
the new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87.
    The minister said ending restrictions on imports of cars
and dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm the
economy.
    Munim said Bangladesh feared a further drop in prices for
its main export jute, ""which will certainly affect our export
earnings"" in the coming year.
    Bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mln
in 1986/87, according official figures.
    But Munim said exports of non-traditional items, which
accounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, would
play a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target.

currency, which threatens to rise above set levels in a basket
of currencies, dealers said.
    The central bank declined comment, but dealers noted the
bank had also intervened and sold small amounts of crowns on
Friday. The bank is committed to defending the crown at certain
levels in a basket of 14 trade-weighted currencies.
    ""They've been in again this morning, selling piecemeal
whenever they think necessary,"" a senior dealer at an Oslo bank,
who declined to be identified, told Reuters.
    The crown's index is currently around 109.60 in the basket
-- close to its upper limit of 109.50 which the central bank is
committed to defending.
    A low index figure indicates a high value for the crown.
The limit at the other end of the scale is set at 114.50.
    The crown has been bolstered by high Norwegian interest
rates, currently around 16 pct in the money market, and better
than expected economic indicators which showed a sharply
reduced foreign trade deficit in May and inflation stabilising
around the current annual rate of 10 pct.

<dateline>    BRUSSELS, June 29 - </dateline>Top-level talks last week between the
European Community (EC) and the United States failed to resolve
a dispute over pasta which may provoke new trade frictions next
month, diplomatic sources said.
    The U.S. Insists the EC complies with what it regards as an
unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT and
dismantles an export subsidy system which has led to Italy
taking an increasing share of the U.S. Pasta market.
    The sources said the EC, which currently provides subsidies
of around 16 cents a pound, offered a compromise in last week's
talks in Brussels but that this was rejected by the U.S.
    U.S. Assistant Special Trade Representative Jim Murphy has
returned to Washington ahead of a theoretical July 1 deadline
for agreement, set last August when the two sides resolved a
related dispute over EC restrictions on U.S. Citrus imports.
    The diplomatic sources said the citrus issue could be
reopened if the pasta dispute was not solved quickly. It was
also possible the U.S. Would reimpose a 40 pct tariff on EC
pasta, lifted when the citrus row was settled.
    But the two sides may agree to extend the deadline for a

inspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a Danish
agriculture ministry official told Reuters.
    The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the
request of the European Commission, which Denmark approached
for support.
    Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an
interview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: ""Denmark will not
accept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reach
an understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC.""
    Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns
in 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community
totalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.
    Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion
that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC
veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.
    But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said
the inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC
regulations. ""Canadian officials are very concerned about the
trade implications. We are holding active discussions with the
EC and bilaterally,"" she added.

<dateline>    VIENNA, June 29 - </dateline>Following are extracts from the
communique issued at the conclusion of the OPEC conference
here.
    ""The conference expressed satisfaction about the positive
results of the agreement signed in December, 1986, by which
OPEC re-established the system of fixed price at a level of 18
dlrs per barrel supported by OPEC production ceilings
distributed into national production levels.
    ""The conference noted that all market indicators, including
spot prices in the market and netback values of all OPEC
crudes, have been firming up significantly, thus consolidating
the OPEC price structure as defined by the agreement.""
    ""The conference examined the supply/demand outlook for the
second half of the year and decided that in order to secure
continued firm prices in the market, OPEC production during the
fourth quarter of 1987 will be equal to that of the third
quarter, I.E. 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd), distributed into
the same national production levels as were defined by the
above-mentioned agreement for that quarter.""
    ""Furthermore, the conference decided to establish a
committee of five heads of delegation to monitor the price
evolution in the market in relation to the OPEC official prices
in order to secure price stability around the opec price
structure.
    ""Should there be any significant change in market prices,
the committee would immediately call for an extraordinary
meeting of the conference with a view to deciding on the
necessary OPEC production levels during the second half of the
year, which would secure the desired market stability.""
    ""The conference reiterated the necessity of member
countries' strict adherence to the agreement signed in December
1986, both in terms of official price, and national production,
levels.
    ""For this purpose, the conference decided to establish a

    ""Moreover, the conference stressed the necessity of the
cooperation of the oil-producing exporting countries outside

<title>POEHL SPEAKS AGAINST GERMAN INTEREST RATE CUT</title>
<dateline>    BONN, June 29 - </dateline>Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said
West Germany would be badly advised to lower interest rates and
that he believed the economy would continue to recover after a
six-month lull.
    Asked by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag if lower interest
rates could boost the domestic economy, Poehl said: ""We would be
badly advised if we forced further interest rate cuts.
    ""This could, under certain circumstances, release new
inflationary fears which would then be more likely to lead to
higher interest rates,"" he added.

    Poehl said Germany had practically no growth in the past
six months because of the mark's surge and the cold winter.
    ""But since April, statistics clearly show that the economy
finds itself on a course of growth,"" he said. ""I expect this
development to continue in the coming months.""
    Asked about his expectations of a U.S.-European Community
trade war, Poehl said such an event would be disastrous.
    ""For this reason we in Europe must avoid everything used by
protectionist forces in the U.S. As pretexts,"" he added. ""This
includes...Eliminating existing restrictions in the EC as far
as possible. Protectionism is not found only in the U.S.""

<title>KUWAIT SEES OPEC OUTPUT OVER CEILING TO END-YEAR</title>
<dateline>    VIENNA, June 29 - </dateline>OPEC output for the second half of 1987,
including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln
barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday,
Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said.
    Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its
ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters
of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter
level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter
target.
    Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, ""OPEC third
quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while
fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd""
    Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production
levels would have on prices.
    Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,
rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to
adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln
barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia
and Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when
a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about
September.
    Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War
enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369
mln in the second half.
    Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from
the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has
been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. ""We will
not discuss it. There will not be any change,"" he said.
    Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended
Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems
to be adressed. ""We are overdoing it in holding too short a
meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet,"" he said.
    Ali said the problem of price differentials between the
prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly
at the meeting.

    Ali said ""The problem of differentials is a real one. I
would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem
has not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced
relative to heavy crudes.""
    Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the
next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said
""If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do
the work of another minister.""
    Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades.
    OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread
of 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes.

<title>INDIA RELAXES RULES FOR EXPORT PROMOTION</title>
<dateline>    NEW DELHI, June 29 - </dateline>The Reserve Bank of India, RBI,
announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use
foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annual
export earnings for export promotion abroad.
    The move is designed by the government to improve India's
trade deficit.
    Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit
Scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various
textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and
electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports
goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.
    The scheme replaces current rules which allow different
amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a
minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.
    RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will
qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional
spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value
of annual export earnings.
    These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and
semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil,
psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.
    RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the
two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their
freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.
    Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably
higher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because
holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to
RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.

<dateline>    MINNEAPOLIS, June 29 - </dateline>DataCard Corp said it adopted a
dividend rights plan in response to Deluxe Check Printers Inc
&lt;DLX&gt; having agreed to sell its 38 pct interest in DataCard to
National Computer Systems Inc &lt;NLCS.O&gt;.
    DataCard declared a dividend distribution of one preferred
stock purchase right on each outstanding share its common
stock. The dividend is designed to deter National Computer or
other potential suitors from preventing DataCard from
evaluating all alternatives to maximize shareholder value,
DataCard said.
   
    National Computer told Reuters June 22 it could make a bid
for DataCard. On June 25 DataCard filed suit in Hennepin County
District Court in Minnesota to block the sale of the 38 pct
stake of its stock to National Computer.
    In announcing the rights plan, DataCard said it ""is not
designed to deter takeovers that would be consistent with the
objective of maximizing stockholders value to all of DataCard's
stockholders.""
    The rights will not become exercisable until 10 days after
an announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial
ownership of 44 pct or more of DataCard's common stock.
   
    Once exercisable, each right would entitle a holder to buy
1/500th of a share of DataCard Series A junior participation
preferred Stock for 35 dlrs. Holders other than an acquirer
would be entitled to purchase, for six-months after the right
becomes exercisable, a number of shares of the new preferred
stock with a market value equal to twice the exercise price of
the rights.
    The rights dividend distribution is payable July 9 to

<dateline>     WASHINGTON, June 29 - </dateline>Enetertainment Marketing Inc and its
president Elias Zinn have demanded a list of Crazy Eddie Inc
shareholders from the company and said they may pursue a merger
of the Edison, N.J. electronics retailer.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Zinn said the demand for the shareholder list was made on June
26 because he may desire to communicate with other Crazy Eddie
shareholders ""regarding the affairs"" of the company.
    Zinn and his firm, which disclosed they hold a 5.1 pct
stake in Crazy Eddie common stock, said they may acquire more
shares through a negotiated merger or tender offer.
    Entertainment Marketing was informed on June 25 by Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc., acting on behalf of Crazy Eddie, that it
would be provided with ""certain information"" about Crazy Eddie,
it told the SEC.
    Entertainment Marketing, a Houston-based firm involved in
electronics wholesaling and televised home shopping sales,
proposed an eight dlr a share merger acquisition of Crazy Eddie
on May 29, and modified the proposal on June 9 to include the
possible participation of Crazy Eddie management.
    Entertainment Marketing told the SEC it expects to meet
with Crazy Eddie representatives in the near future.
    Entertainment Marketing also disclosed that it retained
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc as its financial advisor and
investment banker.
    In light of a June 17 announcement from Crazy Eddie that
Chemical Bank would no longer fund a 52 mln dlr credit facility
with the company, plus further declines in the price of its
stock, Entertainment Marketing and Zinn said they are
""continuing to evaluate their alternatives with respect to
their investment"" in Crazy Eddie stock.
    Depending on its evaluation of the company, including
actions by Crazy Eddie's board and any possible third party
bids for the company, Entertainment Marketing and its president
said they may hold their present stake in the company, sell
some of their shares, or purchase more shares on the open
market, through private purchases or in connection with a
merger or tender offer.
    According to the SEC filing, Entertainment Marketing and
Zinn bought their current holdings of 1,560,000 Crazy Eddie
common shares between May 20 and June 17 at 7.42 dlrs to 7.93

<title>CHANCES OF DIRECT U.S.-IRAN GULF CLASH SEEN LOW</title>
<author>    By Rory Channing, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    KUWAIT, June 29 - </dateline>U.S. moves to increase its warships in
and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on
unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a
direct military clash with Iran, diplomats said.
    They said the American decision inevitably carries some
risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt
rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.
    ""As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the
Gulf could do serious damage,"" said one western diplomat.
    Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks
on ""soft targets"" such as merchant shipping not protected by
American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.
    The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil
tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated
by diplomats as low. However, ""There is the threat that the
Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,
will go for softer targets,"" one diplomat said.
    Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was
""moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.""
    The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10
warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to
patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.
    The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting
Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered
to fly the American flag to give them naval protection.
    Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by
Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.
    Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by
Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is
preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.
    The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to
make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.
    A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a
launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the
Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.
    ""But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti
territory would be a very serious escalation"" likely moving
world opinion against Iran, remarked one.
    Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying
out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.
    Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted
last Friday ""a river of blood"" throughout the world in the event
of any U.S. strike against Iran.
    Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused
of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable
capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.
    Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that
most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to
pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential
trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.
    Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or
other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.

    Gabelli-Rosenthal and Partners LP and G and R Partners,
which hold the remaining 370,700 Digiorgio common shares, told

<title>RAINS HELP U.S. WESTERN CORN BELT, MORE SEEN</title>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, June 29 - </dateline>Weekend rain over the Western Corn Belt
brought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlier
this month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcome
moisture to central and eastern belt locations this week,
according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-Weather
Inc.
    ""There is going to be more rain for the next two, three
days,"" he said. ""We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal to
above normal moisture this week.""
    Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern
Minnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in eastern
Nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.
    Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but
were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.
    Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with
thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.
    ""Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a
pretty good rain,"" Mohler said.
    Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparking
an early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off
19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.
    Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is
expected to move over the central Midwest, then move north
later in the week. That could bring new rain patterns across
the Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions as
early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage
in early July, he said.

approved Citicorp's application to purchase through its

    Citicorp Savings proposed to assume two billion dlrs in

potentially adverse effects of allowing affiliations of banks
and savings and loan associations, although it has allowed bank
holding companies to acquire some failing thrifts.

permissible acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of S

    Citicorp Savings, the successor to the failed Fidelity

<title>GROUP MAY SUPPORT CARDIS CORP &lt;CDS&gt; BUYOUT</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </dateline>A group of companies controlled by
Brookehill Partners Inc told government authorities it may
support a buyout of Cardis Corp as a way to maximize the value
of the company's stock.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
the group disclosed that it currently holds a 5.5 pct stake in
Cardis common stock, and said it ""would likely support"" an
acquisition of the company as a whole or in parts by another
party, terming such a move ""the most likely means for the
company's shareholders to maximize the value of their
investment.""
    Although the group characterized its Cardis stock holdings
as principally for investment, it said it intends to contact
third parties who might be interested in an acquisition of
Cardis, a Los Angeles-based auto parts distributor.
    The group added its has already had ""some contacts"" with
others concerning the company, but said no understandings have
been reached.
    ""The (Cardis) common shares continue to offer opportunity
for price appreciation on the basis of the company's asset
value and earnings momentum,"" the Brookehill group told the
SEC.
    The group, which currently holds 318,900 Cardis common
shares, consists of New York-based Brookehill Partners and its
two subsidiaries, Brookehill Equities Inc, a brokerage, and
Moore, Grossman and deRose Inc, an investment advisor. Walter
Grossmman, S. Edward Moore and Robert deRose, all of New York,
each own one-third interests in Brookehill Partners.
    Since April 27, members of the Brookehill group made net
purchases of 6,000 Cardis common shares at approximately 4 dlrs
a share. The group told the SEC it may continue to purchase
additional Cardis stock, but also reserved the right to sell

<title>SEC SAYS CAMPEAU UNIT VIOLATED DISCLOSURE RULES</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </dateline>The Securities and Exchange
Commission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptly
disclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart a
takeover attempt by Campeau Corp.
    In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and its
legal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the
agency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shopping
center developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau's
takeover offer.
    Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs
on Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo.
    On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board had
urged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a
share, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping
centers to DeBartolo, the SEC said.
    Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who heads
the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of
Sullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SEC
filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in
sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.
    Securities law requires takeover target companies to
promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.
    The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct
of Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a
share from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headed
by DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at
thwarting Campeau, the SEC said.
    Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an
amended SEC filing, the agency charged.
    Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was
made on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct
3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaint
said.
    DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for
control of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in October
when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or
48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes
after it dropped its hostile tender offer.
    The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal
judge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake in
Allied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.
    The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining
with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal
tender offer.
    But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was
dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.
    In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,
the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply
with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.
    Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it
became a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and
quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.

<title>U.S. TO END NETHERLANDS ANTILLES TAX TREATY</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </dateline>The Treasury Department said it
notified the Netherlands that it was terminating the 1948
income tax treaty as it applies to the Netherlands Antilles and
Aruba.
    The termination is effective January 1, 1988, the Treasury
said in a two-sentence announcement.
    The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiations
between the United States and the Netherlands over the past
eight years had failed to reach an accord, a Treasury spokesman
said.
    The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies of
Eurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will no
longer be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, the
spokesman said.
    Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles 
may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early. Most have
maturities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, the
spokesman said.
    He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have an
adverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the general
decline in interest rates means they will be able to refinance
at lower interest rates.
    However, the holders of the bonds presumably will be faced
with lower yields.

<title>SAN FRANCISCO, NOT REGION, HURT BY RESTRUCTURING</title>
<dateline>    SAN FRANCISCO, June 25 - </dateline>Corporate mergers and acquisitions
in and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had
only a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, a
leading business-backed organization said.
    The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 business
firms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a
nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered
some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding
communities had not.
    Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left
due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but
another 21 firms were added to the list.
    Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.
During the period, only six located in the city achieved
Fortune 500 status.
    Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of
McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study
grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously
hurt the economic climate of northern California.
    However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been
lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were
created during the period.
    At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater
rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest
of the United States and California.
    Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and
chief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news
conference that the region had difficulties in persuading
companies to locate there because of a fragmented local
political system.
    But he said that because of the amenities of living in San
Francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other
metropolitan area.
    ""It's a great place to run a business,"" he added, ""but it's
a hell of a place to do business with government.""
    The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf
Oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the
restructuring activity.
    Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period
were Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp;
Cooke and Rolm.
    Companies that grew enough during the period to make the
Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,
McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac.
    The study by the management consulting firm said that,
partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth
in San Francisco has slowed since 1980.
    In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership
had adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic and
charitable activities.

<title>VENEZUELA LOWERS EXCHANGE RATE FOR OIL EARNINGS</title>
<dateline>    CARACAS, June 29 - </dateline>Venezuela's cabinet approved a new
exchange rate for oil and mining export earnings, setting it at
14.50 bolivars to the dollar from 7.50 bolivars previously,
Minister Manuel Azpur UA said.
    Azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
measure is ""fundamental to conserving the economic and financial
strength of the petroleum industry.""
     He said the new exchange rate, which goes before the
central bank for final approval tommorrow, will allow the state
oil company Petroleos De Venezuela, S.A.(PDVSA) to solve its
problem of working capital and implement investment plans,
estimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987. He did not say when
the measure would become effective.
   Venezuela's oil industry previously sold its dollar earnings
to the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreign
exchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars.
   The new exchange rate will promote purchases of domestic
goods and services by the industry, Azpur said. He added that
it would also put PDVSA in a position to purchase more
government debt bonds.                        
    PDVSA had available liquid assets of 20 billion bolivars at
the start of this year, of which nine billion were in a trust
fund in the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) and placed in
government bonds.
  According to a contract between PDVSA and the central bank,
the BCV must provide cash as the oil industry requries by
repurchasing the bonds.
    PDVSA's contribution to the treasury last year was 44.480
billion bolivars. It foreign earnings for oil and petrochemcial

<title>INTEREST RATES HURT U.S. MAY HOUSING SALES</title>
<author>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </dateline>Sales of new single-family homes
tumbled 14.9 pct in May from April levels because of higher
mortgage interest rates, analysts said.
    ""There should be another month or two of very weak new home
sales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homes
should become more stable by mid-summer,"" said economist
Lawrence Chimerine of Wharton Econometrics Inc.
    The drop in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
616,000 units, was the largest since January 1982, the Commerce
Department said.
    Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out at
about 9.08 pct in March and rose to about 10.7 pct in April,
according to Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley.
    The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers out
of the market, he and others said.
    ""The rates moved very suddenly and were certainly
unexpected by homebuyers,"" said Cynthia Latta, an economist
with Data Resources. ""They were so startled, they wanted to
hold back and see what would happen.""
    The drop in sales of new single-family home sales was
sharper than expected, some economists said. ""We fully expected
a decline but the extent was more than we anticipated,"" said
James Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions.
    Christian said there was a sharp rise in May in sales of
existing homes, which are generally less expensive than new
homes.
    Latta of Data Resources said strong sales of new
condominiums in the Northeast and on the West Coast were
reflected in sales of existing but not new homes.
    Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said,
""Underlying housing demand remains strong. I think the market
is going to stabilize and give us a good second half.""
    Others were less optimistic, however.
    ""We clearly won't have a boom (in new home sales) but I
don't think this is the start of a collapse in single-family
housing,"" said Chimerine of Wharton.
    Eugene Sherman, chief economist of the Federal Home Loan
Bank of New York, said, ""The lower sales level will be
maintained for awhile until there is another change in rates.
There won't be much specific improvement in coming months.""

<title>U.S. REASSERTS PLANS FOR DETERRENT ROLE IN GULF</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </dateline>The United States responded to an
apparent escalation of Iranian rhetoric with continued
assurances that its expanded military force in the Gulf would
play purely a deterrent role.
    ""I can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent, that
we're going to be assuring safety for American shipping and
that that shipping is not related to the war itself,"" State
Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.
    He was asked about Iranian claims that the United States
was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran.
    Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday,
""At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink of
an armed encounter with us.
    ""We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S.
Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious. We
are determined to stand firm and will certainly win.""
    The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up its
Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending the
refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the
strategic Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf.
    The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oil
tankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flag
and gain naval protection against Iranian attacks.
    Asked about the Iranian rhetoric, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said, ""We won't have any comment or response to
the Iranian statements. Our position has been made clear about
the status of events in the Gulf. We want an end to the war
with no winners and no losers and any activities or statements
that tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are not
helpful or welcome.""
    Redman said he could not independently confirm reports that
Iran has offered to halt attacks on Gulf shipping.

<title>ISRAEL MINISTER SEES INCREASED EXPORTS TO U.S.</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </dateline>Israel's exports to the U.S. can and
must double over the next five years if the mideast nation's
goal of economic independence is to be achieved, said Gad
Yaacobi, Israeli minister of Economy and Communication.
    Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerce
seminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S.
were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel's total
exports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billion
dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total.
    ""I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reach
five billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn to
function in the American marketplace and place greater emphasis
on product quality,"" Yaacobi said.
    While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis European
currencies is a ""bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,""
Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trend
toward higher U.S. exports.
    In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rose
fivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, while
imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year.
    Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct
annually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
     He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passed
last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial
restrictions between the two nations through 1994, would
continue to facilitate the desired export growth.
    Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act as
an economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S.
firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentage
of the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa.
    Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle
east was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been able
to achieve its economic potential.
    Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs in
aid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing
military conflicts ""which were imposed on Israel,"" he said.
    Short of achieving Israel's full growth potential, however,
Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic
independence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption that
exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.

<title>GENCORP &lt;GY&gt; TO SELL GENERAL TIRE</title>
<dateline>    AKRON, Ohio, June 29 - </dateline>Gencorp Inc and Continental AG of
Hanover, West Germany, jointy announced they signed an
agreement for Continental to buy Gencorp's General Tire Inc
subsidiary for 650 mln dlrs in cash.
    Under the agreement the companies said Continental will
acquire General Tire, including its related domestic and
foreign operations, and Gencorp will retain liability for the
medical benefits of retired General Tire employees who retired
on or before November 30, 1984.
    The sale is expected to be completed on or before November
one and is subject to meeting certain conditions.
    Continental is Europe's second largest tire producer. Last
year, the company had sales of 2.6 billion dlrs, with 1.9
billion dlrs generated by its tire operations.
    Last year, General Tire had operating profits of 79 mln
dlrs on sales of 1.1 billion dlrs, and Gencorp had operating
profits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3.1 billion dlrs.
    GenCorp spokesman Rip Tilden said the company will retain
about 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former General Tire
employees under the agreement.
    Tilden said Gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale to
reduce its 1.5 billion dlr debt.
    In April, GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by a
partnership formed by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG&gt; and Wagner and
Brown with a restructuring program that included the purchase
of up to 54 pct, or 12.5 mln shares, of its common at 130 dlrs
a share for a total of 1.6 billion dlrs
    As part of the restructuring, GenCorp also said it planned
to sell its tire business, the bottling operations of its RKO
General Inc subsidiary, and RKO's remaining broadcast
properties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotive
components businesses.
   
    Tilden said Gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrs
in after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale of
several pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company,
including general tire.
    ""The price paid for General tire would not cause us to
reevaluate that estimate,"" said Tilden.
    General Tire employs 10,000 people worldwide and has four
tire manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada.
    In a statemnet, A. William Reynolds, GenCorp chairman said
the sale of General Tire ""represents a critical accomplishment
in our plan to restructure GenCorp.""
   
    Reynolds also said GenCorp's previously announced sale of
its other businesses are ""proceeding satisfactorily.""
    Among the pieces of Gencorp's empire that remain to be sold
are its RKO bottling operations. GenCorp agreed to sell RKO's
KHJ-TV station to Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS&gt; for
217 mln dlrs. That deal awaits approval by the Federal
Communications Commission. GenCorp also received 257 dlrs after
tax from the sale of RKO's WOR-TV.

<title>PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS</title>
<dateline>    ISLAMABAD, June 29 - </dateline>Pakistani government allowed freer
cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed
at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.
    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a
televised speech the government had also decided to allow
duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry
more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of
Pakistani products.
   
    Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have
been handled exclusively by state corporations since early
1970s.
    But Haq said now the private sector would also export
cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a
long-standing demand of the local traders.
    The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to
bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries
compete effectively in the world market, he said.
   
    Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year
1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but
reviewed every year.
    It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing
trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would
enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a
longer period.
    He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided
for the export of engineering goods to selected third world
countries on soft credit terms.
   
    Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per
cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23
billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.
    He said the government policy was to rationalise and
streamline import controls.
    ""It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,
specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local
industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs,"" he
said. ""Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods
produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise
to smuggling and hampering of exports.""
   
    He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed
from import restrictions.
    Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from
remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the
Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the
drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a
balance of payments crisis for Pakistan.

<title>CITICORP &lt;CCI&gt; SAVINGS EXTENDS CALIFORNIA REACH</title>
<dateline>    OAKLAND, Calif, June 29 - </dateline>Citicorp has extended its reach
into the California market with Citicorp Savings' acquisition
of 50 of Sears Roebuck's &lt;S&gt; Sears Savings Bank branches,
bringing its presences to 143 branches in 101 communities,
CitiCorp Savings said.
    Thrift industry analysts said the move, approved by the
Federal Reserve board today, is a plus for Citicorp and shows
its serious intent to penetrate the California market.
    The acquisition mostly extends Citicorp's reach into
Southern California, where 34 of the 50 branches are located.
Citicorp Savings was predominantly in Northern California.
    ""This marks our first major expansion in California,
particularly in the south,"" said Citicorp Savings President
Edward Valencia, in a statement.
    Thrift industry sources said they do not see a major
near-term impact on the Southern California thrift market, but
do expect Citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor than
Sears was in that market.
    ""We do believe they will be a better competitor than
Sears,"" said James Stutz, Executive Vice President of Home
Federal Savings and Loan Association &lt;HFD&gt;, based in San Diego.
    Banking industry sources said the move is viewed as
groundwork, to establish Citicorp throughout the California
market, well before the 1991 law change that will allow it to
operate as a bank in the state. They said Citicorp is likely to
convert the branches to banks at that time.
    In the near-term, however, analysts said with seven billion
dlrs in assets, Citicorp Savings is still not a major force in
the thrift market, against such large California thrifts as
Home Federal, Great Western Financial Corp &lt;GWF&gt;, H F Ahmanson

<title>U.S./SOVIET GRAIN MEETING UNLIKELY THIS SUMMER</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </dateline>Prospects appear slim for a summer
meeting between U.S. and Soviet officials before the two
countries enter the final year of their bilateral grains
agreement, Agriculture Department officials said.
    The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the
agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up
to last February. However, any delay this year should not
endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends
through September, 1988, USDA officials said.
    ""It will be difficult to pull together the people for the
meeting during July,"" an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel
Amstutz said.
    Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the
next talks could still be a ""couple more months,"" he said.
   
    There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA
will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next
marketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultations
were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made.
    ""I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer
or before the next agreement year begins,"" a USDA source said.
    Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next
year's crops, he said, ""There are too many variables now. It
would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now.""
    Under the nonbinding pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase a
minimum of nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain per year. Soviet and
U.S. officials normally meet in the summer before the start of
a new agreement year to discuss grain quality, shipping
logistics and production outlooks.

<title>JUSTICE OPPOSES QUICK GREYHOUND-TRAILWAYS MERGER</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </dateline>The Justice Department said it asked
the government to proceed cautiously on a plan allowing the
nation's two largest intercity bus companies to merge their
operations, a move one of the firms said may derail the deal.
    Justice's opposition to quick federal approval of a bid by
Greyhound Lines Inc to take immediate control Trailways Corp
prompted Greyhound to threaten -- in a brief filed with the
Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) -- to drop the merger
plan.
    Greyhound officials told Reuters late today the company
hoped for ICC action on the merger by tomorrow.
    ""Greyhound Lines will go forward with the transaction only
if it is permitted to assume immediate, unconditional control
of Trailways' operations and to integrate them with its
operations,"" Greyhound said in a filing with the ICC, the
federal regulatory agency which has the final say over mergers
of interstate bus companies.
    But Justice had said in an earlier filing with the ICC that
it wanted the agency to move slowly on the plan and to turn
down Greyhound's request to begin operating Trailways
immediately.
    ""The department has just begun to receive relevant
information on Trailways' financial condition and is in the
process of assessing the correctness of the company's
allegations,"" acting Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule
said in comments submitted to the ICC.
    Greyhound announced June 19 that it wanted the ICC to let
it begin operating Trailways immediately while continuing to
evaluate the merger for possible antitrust problems.
    Greyhound said it would pay 80 mln dlrs for many of
Trailways' terminals, buses and garages.
    The two companies said in papers filed with the ICC that
Trailways ""could collapse in a matter of days.""
    They said Trailways owed suppliers more than six mln dlrs,
with another six mln dlrs due June 30.
    The suppliers, they said, could force Trailways into
bankruptcy ""at any time.""
    Trailways also owes a consortium of banks 76 mln dlrs, and
the consortium has threatened to call the loan if Trailways
fails to pay the interest due June 30, they said.

<title>MIYAZAWA SAYS G-7 STILL SUPPORTS LOUVRE ACCORD</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </dateline>Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa

Accord to stabilise currencies.
    He also told a news conference following a cabinet meeting
that the Group of Five (G-5) and G-7 do not have any plans to
meet for talks.
    The Finance Minister further said that overseas stock
market plunges will not lead to a freefall in the Tokyo stock
market. ""There is no special worry about the stock market in
Tokyo,"" he added.
    Miyazawa said the Tokyo stock market should not be gravely
affected by the downturns of markets in New York and London
because there is a clear sign of an economic recovery in Japan
and stability of exchange rates.
    Asked if the U.S. Had contacted Japan after the stock

<title>IF DOLLAR FOLLOWS WALL STREET JAPANESE WILL DIVEST</title>
<author>    By Yoshiko Mori</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </dateline>If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street,
Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a
serious way, Japan investment managers say.
    The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollar
securities, have already sold U.S. Equities.
    But ""if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happen
yesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw
significant funds from U.S. Shares,"" said Akira Kawakami, deputy
manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's
international investment department.
    An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japanese
investment in U.S. Bonds. ""Japan-U.S. Interest rate
differentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothing
in the absence of dollar stability,"" said Kawakami.
    U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture
following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S.
Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effect
should be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise.
    But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiating
to see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar was
holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning.
    ""Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in
New York yesterday, most are still looking for chances to
lighten their U.S. Stock inventories,"" Hiromitsu Sunada, manager
of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment
department said.
    Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points
to 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914.
    ""Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult,
considering the dangers,"" said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy general
manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed
income securities marketing group.
    Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once
markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managers
said. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one
or two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for.
The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield for
the 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said.
    ""The basic background which has supported the stocks and
bonds markets has not changed,"" said Norio Okutsu, assistant
general manager of Nikko Securities' bond department. ""But new
outflows of funds to the U.S. Will be decreasing.""  However,
this was already evident three months ago, he said.

<title>WORLD COULD COPE WITH HORMUZ CLOSURE, SUBROTO SAYS</title>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - </dateline>Oil prices would skyrocket for a time if

Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said.

    But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian
Petroleum Association, he said, ""If worst comes to worst and say
the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely

    ""But this is not to say that prices, at least for a short

the situation,"" he declared.
    Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relatively
short-term impact on prices, he added.
    Assessing future price trends, he said, ""Short-term spot
prices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likely
hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per
barrel.
    ""The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greater

havoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize the
situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers.
    In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach a

<title>POEHL SAYS RATE RISES ARE CAUSE FOR CONCERN</title>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, Oct 20 - </dateline>Rises in West German and international
interest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has
no interest in higher capital market rates, Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl said.
    ""We consider the interest rate increase that has occurred
here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,""
Poehl told an investment conference.
    ""I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interest
in higher capital market rates,"" he said.
    Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced a
tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80
pct.
    Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have
seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct
at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in
late September.
    The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to
3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections
of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct.
    These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting
between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt.
    Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed
their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability.
    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in
West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the
dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended.
    But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in
nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday.
    Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not
due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and
currency developments.
    Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said ""You
have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a
policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears.""
 The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he
said.
    Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany,
saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to
international cooperation in interest and monetary policy.
    The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money
supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.
    ""Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of
1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest
rates have risen substantially more,"" Poehl said.
    This had to be taken into account when considering recent
rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to
rising international money market rates that had spilled over
into the German market, he said.
    Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far
ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.
    ""The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is
definitely underway,"" he said, noting that this was not so
noticeable in absolute figures.
    The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also
attracted little attention, he said.

<title>TOKYO STOCK PLUNGE COULD FORCE EASIER MONEY POLICY</title>
<author>    By Rich Miller</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </dateline>Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent
the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even
force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,
government and private economists said.
    A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark
further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major
deflationary impact on the real economy, they said.
    Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently
maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount
rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. 
    Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the
central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance
higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.
    But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15
pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to
raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a
renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.
    Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the
markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded
the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount
rate increase.
    A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.
And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a
further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. ""They need to
support the stock and security markets,"" he said.
    But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change
policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central
bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices
continue to plunge during the rest of the week.
    Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the
economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary
impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.
    With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in
stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and
business confidence, one government economist said.
    ""There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't
be that big,"" said another.
    Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their
own, although they do participate through trust funds and other
investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned
to financial market investments for profits during last year's
economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to
refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.
    Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is
partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have
shifted funds away from financial investments to increase
inventories and step up capital spending, one government
economist said.
    In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price
drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices
will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a
greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,
one central bank official said. ""That will at least take a
couple of days, if not weeks,"" he said.

<title>STOLTENBERG SAYS BAKER MEETING UNDERSCORES ACCORD</title>
<dateline>    BONN, Oct 20 - </dateline>West German Finance minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg said the meeting on Monday with U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker underscored the determination of the U.S.
And West Germany to continue close cooperation to stabilise
foreign exchange rates.
    Stoltenberg told a news conference ""The statement released
yesterday (Monday) after the private meeting .... Emphasized
our determination to continue the close economic cooperation
regarding foreign exchange stabilization and monetary policy.""
    Stoltenberg said that he, Baker and Bundesbank President
Karl Otto Poehl had a very constructive discussion and had all
reached a positive evaluation of the Louvre accord during their
meeting on Monday.
    Stoltenberg said initial contacts with several European
counterparts showed that they shared this view. ""We expect the
declaration of our unified position to have a positive effect,""
he said.
    He noted that the dollar firmed again in late U.S. Trading
after the outcome of the Baker meeting was published.

<title>LOUVRE ACCORD VITAL TO W.GERMANY - STOLTENBERG</title>
<dateline>    BONN, Oct 20 - </dateline>West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg said the Louvre accord was vital to West Germany.
    Stoltenberg told a news conference ""Given West Germany's
unusually high dependence on world trade and exports, it is
vital for West Germany ... To continue its constructive
contribution to trusting (international) cooperation on the
basis of the Louvre accord.""
    Some monetary analysts have speculated that
inflation-conscious Bundesbank vice president Helmut
Schlesinger may have been leading the central bank to a course
of tighter monetary policy.
    Stoltenberg is due to attend a routine Bundesbank meeting
on Thursday in West Berlin. He declined to forecast what, if
any, policy decisions the Bundesbank might take.

Stoltenberg declined to comment on whether unpublished target
zones for currencies agreed at last February's Louvre accord
had been changed as a result of the meeting on Monday with U.S.

    He was asked about target zones at a news conference in

Monday's meeting, which said continuing cooperation was aimed
at promoting currency stability at current levels. This was the

<title>IRAN SAYS U.S. RAID CAUSED 500 MLN DLRS DAMAGE</title>
<dateline>    NICOSIA, Oct 20 - </dateline>U.S. Attacks on two Iranian oil platforms
in the Gulf -- both of which were still blazing -- caused
damage estimated at 500 mln dlrs, Tehran Radio quoted Iranian
Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.
    The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American
destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after
the attack and could cause widespread pollution in the Gulf,
the minister told a news conference in Tehran. He said the
Reshadat rigs, 120 miles (200 km) east of Bahrain in
international waters, were in the final stages of
reconstruction after an attack by Iraqi jets last year.

<title>INDONESIA FINDS NEW OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS RESOURCES</title>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - </dateline>The Indonesian state-owned oil company
Pertamina has found new offshore oil and gas resources in East
Aceh, on the western tip of northern Sumatra, a company
spokesman said.
    The spokesman said the discovery was made at the GOS IA-1
offshore exploratory well about 38 kms east of Langsa in Aceh.
    ""Oil and gas are found in sand layers at the depth of 2,300
metres within the Baong formation,"" he said.
    He said preliminary tests showed that the well could flow
oil at the rate of 1,320 barrels a day with 50 degrees API at
20 degrees centigrade through a 5/8 inch choke.
    ""The well also flows natural gas at the rate of 12 mln
standard cubic feet a day,"" he added.
    GOS IA-1 well, located at a water depth of 41 metres, was
drilled under a production sharing contract between Pertamina
and Japex North Sumatra Ltd, each having 50 pct shares.
    ""Petroleum operations are to be carried out by Pertamina as
operator through a joint operating body established by the two
companies,"" the Pertamina spokesman stated.
    The contract covers the Gebang block contract area. The two
companies have previously completed the drilling of GOS IIA-1
exploratory well, around 14 kms south of GOS IA-1.

<title>INDONESIA SAYS IT WILL EXTEND OIL CONTRACTS</title>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - </dateline>Indonesia told the oil industry on
Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and
improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased
expenditure on exploration in return.
    President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian
Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend
contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.
    ""In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the
government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending
production sharing contracts under the present laws,"" Suharto
said.
    ""Apart from that, the government will keep improving the
investment climate in order to accelerate the development of
the petroleum industry,"" he said.
    Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he
was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that
contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be
renewed before they would invest in further exploration.
    ""As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully
aware of this situation,"" Subroto said.
    ""The government has already made the political decision to
entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers
to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a
selective basis.""
    Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil
reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil
industry sources say.
    Subroto said the government was also working to ease other
problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or
deep water conditions.
    But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way
and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now
that the oil price had recovered.
    President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of
technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil
industry for the regions in which companies operated.
    Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company
Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production
expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to
fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in
1986.
    Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation
contracts with foreign oil companies.
    Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field
operations was a government priority. There had been
misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry
in certain areas, such as when a field is designated
commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.
    He said the government wanted to finalise contract
extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the
meantime to maintain its exploration drive.
    Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain
exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire
within 10 years. ""This need in itself is some sort of guarantee
that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.""
    Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal
between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.
    Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved
detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.
    Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions
would be selective, based on how much capital would be
invested.

<title>IRAN PLANS TO FILE LAWSUITS OVER U.S. RAID</title>
<dateline>    NICOSIA, Oct 20 - </dateline>Iran is preparing lawsuits to file for
compensation from the U.S. Over the American raid on its Gulf
oil platforms, Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.
    The lawsuits would be filed with competent international
bodies once the exact damage was calculated, he was quoted
telling a news conference in Tehran. He earlier estimated the
damage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs.
    The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American
destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after
the attack, he said.
    Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was
preliminary. Washington has said the attack was in response to
a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle
City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
    He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs
""except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence."" Reacting to
Weinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed,
Aqazadeh said: ""Iran will also consider the case closed after
its retaliatory measure."" Iranian officials have said their
response would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests
around the world might come under attack.
    Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf
aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's
oil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attack
significantly affecting oil prices.
    IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the
attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the
entrance to the Gulf.
    ""If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait, no other country can
either, and this would be to everyone's harm,"" the radio quoted
him as saying.

April authorization to buy back up to three mln shares and
authorization for further repurchases under the old program has
been withdrawn.

<title>CHEMICAL &lt;CHL&gt;, MARINE MIDLAND &lt;MM&gt; CUT PRIME</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </dateline>Chemical Bank and Marine Midland Banks
Inc said they are cutting their prime lending rate to 9-1/4 pct
from 9-3/4 pct, reversing an increase that they announced just
last week.
    The reduction is effective immediately.
    No other major U.S. bank had followed the lead of Chemical
and Marine Midland, preferring to keep their prime rates at
9-1/4 pct while they waited to see what course money market
rates would take.
    Following Monday's record fall in Wall Street stock prices,
money market rates fell sharply on Tuesday as investors
ploughed proceeds into short-term instruments and the Federal
Reserve said it is prepared to provide liquidity to support the
economy and the financial system.
    Eurodollar deposit rates in London fell by as much as 9/16
percentage point, Treasury bill rates fell by as much as half a
point (after falling between 59 and 84 basis points on Monday),
and the Fed funds rate dropped to 7-1/4 pct from Monday's
average of 7.61 pct. Speculation even surfaced of a discount
rate cut to calm the markets, dealers said.

directors amended the company's shareholder rights plan in
moves it said were designed to preserve stockholder protection
and provide flexibility to the plan.
    Yesterday, Crazy Eddie agreed not to oppose a slate of
candidates to its board proposed by the Committee to Restore

    Crazy Eddie said the new amendments limit future amendments
to the plan, modify the definition of ""continuing directors""
and permit amendment or termination of the plan with the
consent of the company's shareholders if there are no
continuing directors in office or the approval of at least
three such directors cannot be obtained.
    The company also said it approved a certificate of
designation with respect to its 4.5 mln shares of authorized,
but previously undesignated and unissued shares of preferred
stock and adopted an employee stock ownership plan.
    Crazy Eddie also that it requested that the shareholder
group make a commitment not to take the company private until
Crazy Eddie has had a chance to recover from current financial
difficulties, a committment that the group rejected.
    Crazy Eddie said it will hold its annual shareholders

<title>NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY - LYNG</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </dateline>The Soviets have not indicated an
urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely
that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit
expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng told Reuters.
    In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did
not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat
subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.
    ""Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.
There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that
there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a
wheat subsidy).""
    When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet
summit, Lyng said, ""No, I don't think so. I don't think that.""
    The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to
Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for
discussion at a summit.
    ""It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the
Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions
about,"" Lyng said.
    ""When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for
agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was
not something that would be discussed with the President of the
United States. He said it's not presidential,"" Lyng said.
    Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major
producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the
still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final
decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.
    The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement
will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the
Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the
long-standing agreement.
    ""We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have
failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would
love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,
but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.
These are some of the questions we need to discuss.""
    When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from
the agreement, Lyng said, ""I don't know. It certainly hasn't
been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running
they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an
agreement.""

<title>LOUVRE REAFFIRMATION NOT ENOUGH - U.K. ANALYSTS</title>
<author>    By Rowena Whelan</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </dateline>U.S. And West German reaffirmation of
support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental
problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the
current collapse in stock markets, London economists said.
    ""There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the
dollar is going to be allowed to slip,"" said Richard Jeffrey of
Hoare Govett. ""If not, there is going to be continued fear that
when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to
tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the
U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.""
    But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which
dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the
very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation
fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.
    ""If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street
...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,"" said
Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from
other London and Tokyo analysts.
    Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of
further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary
pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.
    Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the
equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.
    ""It would be suicidal for any government in the context of
what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their
interest rates,"" he added.
    Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime
lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed
chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial
system.
    The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock
collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking
crisis for example, thus precipitating recession.
    It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of
1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said
today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and
that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in
mind.
    ""The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.
If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic
growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a
more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,"" said Capel's
Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in
danger.
    ""The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is
disappearing from the equity markets,"" Dennis noted.
    David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world
market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven
(G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,
as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies
is still on.
    Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by
expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money
supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency
stability.
    But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said
Morrison. ""The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To
stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong,"" he said.

<title>U.K. CREDIT POLICY SEEN STEADY, DESPITE BANK DATA</title>
<author>    By Sandy Critchley</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </dateline>An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg
surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to
nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as
long as sterling remains in its present robust state,
economists said.
    An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the
past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit
demand which has largely been behind growth in lending.
    ""In the normal course of events the markets would have been
extremely worried about that figure,"" noted Peter Spencer, U.K.
Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.
    After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,
which compared won stg August rise, U.K.
Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee
from plummetting equities into the relative security of
government securities.
    Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a
day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,
before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone
throughout.
    U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,
resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning
after little more than a token blip as the figures came out.
    Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks
would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a
rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, ""With
the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last
thing the Bank of England would want to do,"" Spencer said.
    ""The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as
sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,""
said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu
Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money
measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct
growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.
    But ""The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed
down is a rather encouraging sign,"" noted Paul Temperton, U.K.
Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a
fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money
aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.
    It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank
of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates
to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by
news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.
    Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in
that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.
    Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in
influencing consumer behaviour, he said.
    In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity
markets in the past few days, ""There will almost certainly be a
straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail
sales,"" Temperton said.
    ""Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in
consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,"" he added.
    ""I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending
figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very
serious panic and a flight to quality,"" Spencer said.
    A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look
at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,
adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly
than bank lending.
    Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending
was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy
personal sector borrowing.
    Figures from the Banking Information Service showed
personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66
billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much
of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments.

<title>NORWAY BOOSTS OIL OUTPUT BY 22 PCT IN SEPTEMBER</title>
<dateline>    OSLO, Oct 20 - </dateline>Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2
pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in
August, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here.
    Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at
several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at
fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field
rescue project.
    Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's
voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil
output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise
oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.
    Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the
production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all
its North Sea fields for the rest of the year.
    Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway
would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.
    The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which
pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,
field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.
    Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use
the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while
Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.
    BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula
field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping
to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.
    Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd
last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company
said.
    September production was also sharply higher at the
Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which
extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd
against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats
Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.
    Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like
Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd
in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous
month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.
    Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd
in September, compared with 100,188 in August.
    Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test
output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl
totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in
August.
    Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on
stream a second well, cutting September production to just two
days.

to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.
    Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd
last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company
said.
    September production was also sharply higher at the
Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which
extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd
against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats
Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.
    Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like
Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd
in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous
month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.
    Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd
in September, compared with 100,188 in August.
    Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test
output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl
totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in
August.
    Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on
stream a second well, cutting September production to just two
days.

    The Tehran leadership have been quick to threaten vengeance
after the U.S. Raids on the rigs, one of which was destroyed.

<title>LYNG PLEASED EC TO OFFER GATT FARM PROPOSAL</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </dateline>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a
global farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although the
United States opposes key parts of the proposal.
    ""We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.
It will help us in getting the negotiations underway,"" Lyng
told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.
    Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg
endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.
The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay
round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.
    Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan
seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing
curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.
    The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all
farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has
pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching
a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.
    However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the
Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is
unrealistic.
    Asked about such criticism, Lyng said ""The alternative to
doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I
think that is the unrealistic position.""
    ""I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are
trying to say.""
    Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a
freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations 
started.
    ""All that some countries would like to have would be a
wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.
That doesn't do a thing for us,"" Lyng said.
    The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of
agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he
said.
    At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is
expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC.
    The United States will be represented at the meeting by
former agriculture undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, recently
appointed special U.S. negotiator on agriculture.

<title>JACOBS SELLS STAKE IN GILLETTE &lt;GS&gt;</title>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, Oct 20 - </dateline>Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs said he
sold the stake he held in Gillette Co &lt;GS&gt; after deciding that
he could not force Gillette to accept a 47 dlr a share takeover
bid made by Revlon Group Inc &lt;REV&gt;.
    Revlon's bid expired last week after being repeatedly
rejected by Gillette. Jacobs had earlier considered waging a
proxy fight over Gillette.
    Jacobs told Reuters he sold the Gillette stake, which he
called ""substantial"" but under five pct, a few weeks ago over a
period of several days. He said he sold the stock at a profit,

    Gillette's stock was at 24-1/8, up 1/8, in morning trade,
off the high of 45-7/8 reached after Revlon announced its bid.
    Jacobs said he sold his Gillette stake based on an
""investment decision. I surely did not see this happening,"" he
said of Monday's stock market free-fall.
    A Gillette spokesman said the mpany had no comment.
    Jacobs said he and fellow investor Carl Pohlad continue to
hold a stake in Allegheny International Inc &lt;AG&gt;. In August
they disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing
that they had acquired 854,900 shares, or 7.9 pct, of Allegheny

<title>DONALD REGAN SAYS U.S. SHOULD EASE CREDIT SUPPLY</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </dateline>Donald Regan, President Reagan's
former chief of staff, said the government should loosen the
money supply, try to keep interest rates down and try to reduce
the federal budget and trade deficits to avoid a recession.
    ""I think what we have to face now is trying to preserve our
economy,"" the one-time chairman of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc
&lt;MER&gt; said in an interview on the ABC television network.
    ""We've got to loosen money, we've got to keep interest rates
down. We can't afford to let them go up. That means we're going
to have to work on our twin deficits, both the budget deficit
and the trade deficit,"" Regan said.
     ""I certainly wouldn't tighten money at this particular
moment,"" Regan said when asked about the prospects for a
recession following Monday's price drop on Wall Street.
    ""I think that if they were to do that, they'd create the
same conditions that we did in '29...They choked off the money
supply and what happened? We went into a major recession. I
think that's the one thing we've got to avoid right now.""
    Regan also called on the government to impose restrictions
on program trading. ""I think that that's exacerbated,
exaggerated this decline, and I think it's something that they
must stop,"" he said.

<title>GATT CASE AGAINST JAPAN A MODEL FOR U.S. - LYNG</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </dateline>Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
said the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaint
against Japan, expected soon, may influence the U.S. stance in
negotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas.
    The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japan
end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the
end of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will
favor the U.S.
    ""These are quota items, and the principles that apply to
them, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question of
whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus,"" Lyng
told Reuters in an interview.
    He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas on
beef and citrus after March 31, next year.
    The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United
States has challenged include items such as tomato paste, some
cheeses and specialty fruit juices.
    U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would
be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has
been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman.
    The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus
quotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect
Japanese farmers.
    ""We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on
beef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that an
illegal action in the GATT, Lyng said.
    He declined to say what action the U.S. would take next
April if Japan continues to resist U.S. demands.

<title>U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES</title>
<author>    By Lisa Vaughan</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </dateline>The United States is prepared to ""pull out
all the stops"" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador
to GATT Michael Samuels said.
    Those rights are now being challenged by the European
Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a
conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.
    He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if
the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without
the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.
    The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect
on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat
shipments into the EC.
    The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.
trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed
prices over the current market level and which may be extended
to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.
    Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,
an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade
negotiations, ""is meaningless if import barriers continue to be
erected,"" Samuels said.
    Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm
subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, ""visionary""
and ""very serious.""  The EC and Japan have said it is
unrealistic.
    The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal
on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally
next week.
    The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce
tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals
substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of
farm subsidies.
    The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as
they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major
trade distortions, Samuels said.
    Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally
submitted and respond to it officially then.
    ""We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este
declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,""
the U.S. Ambassador said.
    The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores
the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.
    The key difference between the two approaches is that the
U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing
only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.
    If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,
there would be little incentive for the Community to work to
correct the international trade situation, he added.
    Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC
oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to
third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the
U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

<title>US WARNS IRAN, BEGINS ESCORTING TANKER CONVOY</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </dateline>The United States warned Iran again 
that it was ready to retaliate for any further hostile military
action in the Gulf as U.S. warships began escorting another
tanker convoy southward from Kuwait.
    U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said the U.S.
sought no further Gulf hostitilies but was ready to deal with
any Iranian response to Monday's attack on an Iranian oil rig.
    Several hours later, the Pentagon announced that U.S.
warships had begun escorting two U.S. flag Kuwaiti tankers --
the 80,000 ton product carrier Ocean City and 46,000 ton
liquified petroleum tanker Gas King -- southward from Kuwait.
    The Defense Department said the 12th such convoy of U.S.
flagged Kuwaiti tankers through the Gulf began at 0230 EDT
under the escort by the U.S. guided missile frigate Ford. It
did not say what oth U.S. warships were in the area.
    ""It (the convoy) is now progressing uneventfully in the
central Gulf,"" the Pentagon statement said.
    Asked on NBC's ""Today"" program if the United States was

<title>LYNG DEFENDS U.S. EXPORT SUBSIDY PROGRAM</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </dateline>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said the United States will continue its policy of
subsidizing farm exports to regain lost markets until there is
a global agreement to end such subsidies.
    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also acknowledged he was
troubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program
(EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting U.S. exports
that the U.S. would have difficulty abandoning it.
    ""Yes, I'm troubled with that a little bit,"" he said. ""There's
no question about it, the longer you feed the calf on the cow,
the longer it is to wean it.""
    In recent months, USDA has offered subsidies on a growing
list of commodities to an increasing number of countries.
    Lyng called U.S. and European Community export subsidies
""just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy"" and said he saw an
end to the expansion of the EEP.
    ""I'm sure there's an end to the expansion, but we are doing
this to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets that
we've lost, to keep our products competitive and to let those,
particularly the European Community, who, we are convinced, are
the worst offenders in terms of the export subsidization, that
we are prepared to continue to do this until we can come to
some agreement to put an end to it,"" he said.

<title>SOVIET 1988 OIL OUTPUT TARGET AT 625 MLN TONNES</title>
<dateline>    MOSCOW, Oct 20 - </dateline>The Soviet oil production target for 1988
has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes over
this year's planned output.
    Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday
at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament.
    He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil
deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an
upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation
which began in late 1983.
    Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil,
slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln.
    January-September figures released at the weekend showed
Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467
mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million.
    Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil
deposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog
prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.
    The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988

between finance ministers of the major nations.
    He said the dispute was a row which should not have

<title>BAKER SEEN WINNING GERMAN INTEREST RATES BATTLE</title>
<author>    By Felix Dearden</author>
<dateline>    BONN, Oct 20 - </dateline>The United States appears to have won a
transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest
rates, European economists said.
    But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing
the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were
plunging.
    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to
currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,
according to official statements released late Monday.
    Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the
Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks
liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct
facility rate offered last week.
    While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank
president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added
money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a
strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.
     ""It's round one to the Americans, "" said Richard Reid,
senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in
London.
    But Reid added, ""We shouldn't forget that it has taken one
of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West
Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05
percentage point.""
    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening
of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and
fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.
    Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's
Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary
policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -
the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
    The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets
and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading
in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was
quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.
    Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche
Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world
stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West
German short-term interest rates on Tuesday.
    ""The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market
losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits
with Baker's wishes, then all the better,"" he said.
    No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the
Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises
in the U.S., Aschoff said.
    Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central
bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he
thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.
    Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston
Ltd in London said ""The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat
and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the
security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was
before the IMF meeting last month in Washington.""
    Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was
reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity
at 3.60 pct, Keating noted.
    Economists said the United States now appeared to have
agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support
the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.
    Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder
Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg
told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule
out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening
on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.
    Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West
Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency
stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central
banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them
to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.

<title>EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA</title>
<dateline>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 20 - </dateline>The European Community (EC) agreed a
trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country
following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC
officials said.
    Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina
will gain additional trading rights on a series of products
including meat, fish and cereals by-products.
    But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with
Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the
officials said.
    The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC
states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased
quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.
    Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,
saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals
substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the
officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from
improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the
quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500
tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will
be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.
    Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of
5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced
levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.
    The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said
that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their
exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They
have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade).
    But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve
Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had
been affected by the country's EC membership.
    Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the
fish dispute with Canada.
    Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC
claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has
improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied
with Japanese offers of compensation.
    Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on
citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some
other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear
and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.
    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told
journalists: ""We maintain our position that the (Japanese)
concessions were not enough.""
    ""We hope that there will be an improvement,"" he said.

Lawson said the collapse of British share prices this week held
no implication so far for domestic interest rates.
    He said in a television interview that ""there is nothing in
the events of the past few days to increase the upward pressure
on (U.K.) interest rates.""
    Sterling has so far stayed solid during the crisis, backed
by strong economic fundamentals and by 10 pct bank base lending
rates, analysts said. Lawson's comments followed another
frantic day in London's financial center, where British shares
closed 12.2 pct down on the day.

<title>US SENATE CUTS OFF STALL TACTICS ON GULF BILL</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </dateline>Confronted by new hostilities
involving U.S. forces in the Gulf, the U.S. Senate voted to end
Republican stalling tactics and limit debate on a measure that
could give Congress a larger role in Gulf policy.
    The measure, however, does not require President Reagan to
comply with the 1973 War Powers Act as does a related Senate
bill. The controversial War Powers Act could require a pullout
of U.S. forces from the Gulf.
    The Senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit
debate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires Reagan
to report to Congress on Gulf policy within 60 days and calls
for a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on the
situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later.
    The resolution could be about any Gulf-related issue,
including an expression of support or of disapproval for
Reagan's policy of protecting 11 Kuwaiti tankers from Iran in
the waterway. The Pentagon said the 12th U.S.-protected convoy
began moving through the Gulf early Tuesday.

<title>STOLTENBERG SAYS CRITICISM NOT ""ONE-WAY STREET""</title>
<dateline>    BONN, Oct 20 - </dateline>Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he
was surprised by recent criticism of West German economic
policies voiced by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker but
added that the criticism was not purely one-sided.
    Stoltenberg told the West German Trade and Industry
Association (DIHT) that before a meeting with Baker on Monday,
""There had been surprising notes of criticism (from the United
States)."" He added. ""Criticism is not a one-way street.""
    He did not elaborate, but Bonn has often called on the U.S.
To reduce its federal budget deficit.
    Over the weekend Baker had criticised West German economic
policies, saying that rises in domestic interest rates here
were not in the spirit of last February's Louvre pact to
stabilise currencies.
    Stoltenberg told the DIHT that his meeting on Monday with
Baker had resolved differences between the two countries.
    At a news conference earlier on Tuesday Stoltenberg had
declined to comment specifically on Baker's criticisms, but he
had said that after three hours of discussions on Monday, ""one
remark or another has been clarified.""

<title>US RULED OUT ATTACK ON IRANIAN SILKWORMS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </dateline>U.S. military planners ruled out
Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack
mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the
Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.
    U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and
raided another in what the administration called a ""measured and
appropriate response"" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last
Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.
    Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig
rather than an onshore economic or military target such as
Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to
limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at
home and in the Gulf.
    ""It simply demonstrated the United States will take military
action when they (Iran) take military action,"" Norman Polmar, a
defense analyst and author, said.
    He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the
embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding
an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.
    In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the
potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that
could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.
    Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq
war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target
to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a
Security Council call for a ceasefire.
    ""We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any
chance at all,"" he said, adding that the action made it clear
tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.

   In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon
to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington
also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's
economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had
been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the
lower Gulf.
    ""We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown
Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting
capabilities,"" Cordesman said.
    He predicted the United States would respond to any future
major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar
Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the
approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.
    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the
United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, ""but
we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action
by Iran with stronger countermeasures.""

<title>SPAIN APPEALS FOR EC HELP ON MAIZE IMPORTS</title>
<dateline>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 20 - </dateline>Spanish farm minister Carlos Romero,
speaking at a meeting of EC farm ministers, called for action
to help the Spanish maize market, Spanish diplomatic sources
said.
    Spain is threatened with massive imports from third
countries by the end of the year, they said.
    They said the imports are due to come in as a result of the
accord by which the EC has promised the United States it will
import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum
into Spain from third countries this year.
    Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a
reduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee may
decide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board to
make direct purchases.
    The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries
should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the
Spanish market.
    They said he threatened to withhold support for the EC
Commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached
would mean price cuts unless Spain received some help.
    The sources said no direct reply was given to Romero at the
meeting.

<title>TELEX &lt;TC&gt; ADOPTS SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN</title>
<dateline>    DALLAS, Oct 9 - </dateline>Telex Corp said its board adopted a
shareholder rights plan which will allow shareholders to
purchase one common share for two dlrs if a hostile group
acquires 15 pct or more of the company.
    However, the company said the plan will not be triggered by
purchases pursuant to the 65 dlrs a share tender offer
commenced on October 9 by a unit of TLX Partners, a group
controlled by New York financier Asher Edelman.
    It said the rights will be distributed on a one for one
basis to all shareholders as of October 30 and may be redeemed
before they become exercisable at five cents per right.
    The company said the rights will expire on the later of
February 17 next year or 60 days from the date they become
exercisable. It said the plan was intended to protect
stockholders against any attempt to take unfair advantage of
the recent decline in stock prices or to use abusive tactics
such as market accumulations which would interfere with its
ability to maximize stockholder value.
    The rights become exercisable if any person or group
acquires 15 pct or more of the company's common stock other
than through an all cash tender offer for all outstanding
shares at 65 dlrs per share.
     It said the rights will also not become exercisable if the
company is acquired by a group under an agreement made with its
board.
     A spokeswoman told Reuters the company would have an
official response to Edelman's bid by Friday, Oct 23.

<title>SAUDI ROLE IN GULF PRAISED BY U.S. OFFICIALS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </dateline>Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah
bin Abdul Aziz was thanked by the Reagan administration for his
country's close, and closed-mouthed, cooperation with
Washington in the Gulf, a senior U.S. official said.
    ""The Saudis are being very cooperative. It would be nice if
the Saudis would go more public, but it's their real estate,""
said the official who asked not to be named.
    He declined to describe what sort of help the Saudis were
providing, saying that Saudi officials are reluctant to
acknowledge their role in the Gulf where the United States has
stationed forces to protect shipping lanes.
    The prince met Vice President George Bush on Monday after
U.S. naval forces attacked offshore Iranian oil platforms in
what Washington said was retaliation for an Iranian attack on a
ship moored off Kuwait and flying the U.S. flag.
    Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the
attack, the prince, who is here on an official visit, replied,
""I believe what the United States has done is their
responsibility as a superpower.""

<title>BANK OF NEW YORK REAFFIRMS TERMS FOR IRVING &lt;V&gt;</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </dateline>The Bank of New York Corp &lt;BK&gt; said it
reaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despite
the drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8, a
Bank of New York spokesman said.
    ""The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer,"" a
Bank of New York spokesman said.
    Irving would not comment on how the drop in the market
affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back
any of its own shares.
    Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequate
and said it wanted to retain its independence.
    In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per
share in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6
pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one
Irving share.
    At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to
80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per
share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.
    According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender
for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.
    Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would
affect the acquisition.
    ""If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve
it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,""
said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.
    ""And the market is saying the deal won't go through,""
Alpert said.
    ""The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at
present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a
share, then they won't go at a lower price,"" another analyst
said.
    The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford
to retain its original offer.
    However, industry sources were more uncertain about
prospects for the deal.
    ""With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will
look good to Irving shareholders,"" said Michael Flores, a
consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm.
    The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is
about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases
the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said.
    Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely
to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking
industry.
    ""Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use
their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price
is too depressed,"" Alpert said.
    Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other
possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said.
    ""In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered
more than the acquirees,"" another analyst said.

<title>BRAZIL'S SEPT TRADE SURPLUS HIGHEST OF THE YEAR</title>
<dateline>    RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 20 - </dateline>Brazil's September trade surplus
was the best so far this year, totalling 1.494 billion dlrs,
compared with 1.434 billion dlrs in August and 540 mln dlrs in
September last year, Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department
(Cacex) director Namir Salek said in a news conference.
    September exports were 2.694 billion dlrs, slightly down
from 2.76 billion dlrs in August. Imports in September amounted
to 1.2 billion dlrs, against 1.32 billion dlrs in August.
    Salek said the accumulated surplus in the Jan-Sept period
was 7.857 billion dlrs, compared with 8.667 billion dlrs in a
similar 1986 period.
    Coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports, up from 222
mln dlrs in August and 212 mln in September 1986, Salek said.
    The Cacex director said he expected the country's trade
surplus to average 800 mln dlrs in the remaining three months
of the year, estimating the year's overall surplus to reach
10.2 billion dlrs, from 25.6 billion dlrs worth of exports and
15.4 billion dlrs of imports.
    He attributed the good surplus on exports of manufactured
and semimanufactured goods. He mentioned car exports, which
accounted alone with sales of 617 mln dlrs in the Jan-Sept
period, against 194 mln dlrs in a similar 1986 period.

<title>TREASURY'S BAKER UNDER FIRE FOR WALL STREET DROP</title>
<author>    By Alver Carlson</author>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </dateline>As official Washington sought to
restore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street
collapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from
critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.
    Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for
boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an
international accord to stabilize currency values.
    Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was
among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped
spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors
think that a clash between the two major economic powers would
damage the world economy.
    Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, ""I
think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I
think, was partly due to statements that have been made by
senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic."" It was a
dispute that should never have happened, he added.
    Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a
hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  
still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United
States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to
Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.
    Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, ""His
timing could not have been worse.""
    One government bond salesman in New York said, ""He actually
thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack
the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much
understanding of international monetary gamesmanship.""
    However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march
toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.
    ""On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if
you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial
markets), it was West German policy,"" said Robert Brusca of
Nikko Securities International in New York.
    ""All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so
making him responsible for it was a little like killing the
messenger,"" he said.
    After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments
made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together
in Paris in February, was still in effect.
    Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be
a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to
the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash
wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.
   Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about
Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the
global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest
rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.
    He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th
month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic
expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge
market for debtor country exports.
    Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried
that the Republican party might face next year's presidential
election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly
tarnished.
    A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt
crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has
already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.
    ""There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the
economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around
quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and
eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,""
former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a
television interview.
    In many ways, the official response was mild.
    Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,
with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting
that he was ""puzzled.""
    U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately
returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments
and, presumably, their political impact.
    For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in
Washington will diminish because of the market fall.
    Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because
of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd
Bentsen said with some irony, ""Oh, I think it's much too late to
be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the
attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---
retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't do
that.""

<title>CONVOY RUNS GULF GAUNTLET, OTHER SHIPS STAY CLEAR</title>
<dateline>    BAHRAIN, Oct 20 - </dateline>A new convoy of tankers escorted by
American warships headed down the Gulf on Wednesday, towards
Iranian oil platforms still oozing smoke after having being
blasted by U.S. Navy raiders.
    Some Gulf sea captains were reported to be steering well
clear of Iran's Silkworm missiles, however, and frontline
emirate Kuwait redeployed air defences to counter the threat.
    ""I think the predominant feeling ... Is of being scared this
conflict will escalate,"" a top West German Foreign Ministry
official, Helmut Schaefer, told reporters in Bahrain after a
tour of three Gulf states.
b
    Shipping sources said on Tuesday night at least six sea
captains had voiced fears that Iran would avenge Monday's U.S.
Raids by unleashing more Silkworm missiles at ships plying the
Gulf.
    Belgium decided two minesweepers en route for the Gulf
would stay out for the time being following Monday's U.S.
Action.
    But there was no sign that the prospect of more tit-for-tat
assaults had reduced the level of shipping activity in the
area.
    Iran, having vowed to react strongly after Monday's U.S.
Action, launched a barrage of threats and ridicule.
    For its part, Washington warned Iran again on Tuesday that
it was ready for any further hostile action.
    Pentagon officials then announced that a U.S. Guided

the U.S. flag southwards--the 80,000 tonne product carrier
Ocean City and 46,000 tonne petroleum tanker Gas King.

<title>U.S. MAY END ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST JAPAN</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </dateline>The United States may lift an
additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later
this month, Reagan Administration officials said.
    President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on
Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986
agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third
country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.
    The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on
Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and
portable computers.
    Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after
Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at
below production costs.
    Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory
and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.
    The Administration officials said Commerce Department 
monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the
semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking
sales away from American-made semiconductors.
    They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would
be lifted by the end of the month.
    The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the
closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.
    U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance
with the agreement earlier this week.
    The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining
sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is
in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </dateline>Southland Corp said it was told the 
Securities and Exchange Commission ordered a private
investigation into Southland stock trading and statements made
by the company this year.
    ""Southland has been advised that the Commission has issued
a private order of investigation concerning the trading of
Southland stock during various times in 1987 and the issuance
of various public statements by Southland,"" Southland said in a
proxy statement to shareholders.
    Southland did not elaborate on the SEC order of
investigation, and company officials could not be reached for
comment late Tuesday.
    The SEC has a long-standing policy against confirming or
denying the existence of investigations.
    The proxy statement, filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, is required for a November 5 shareholders meeting
called to approve the previously announced acquisition of
Southland by a company controlled by Southland chairman John
Thompson and members of his family.
    Earlier this year, a group led by Thompson acquired
majority ownership of Southland through a 77 dlrs a share
tender offer for 31.5 mln shares of Southland common stock.
    If the merger is approved, common stock still outstanding
will be converted into the right to receive 61.32 dlrs a share
in cash plus a fraction of a share of preferred stock.

    While few details were released, Carney said the government
would also be pressing for an improvement in market access and
new measures to ensure countries do not erect artificial
barriers.
    ""Under the Canadian proposal, all countries would have to
ensure that domestic policies and programs to address the
specific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade,"" a

    ""Furthermore, in assessing the trade impact of programs,
credit could be given to countries which effectively control
the output of farm products,"" the papers said.

<title>US SAYS CANADIAN, ISRAELI PACTS SHOULD SPUR TRADE</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </dateline>Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada
and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the
global trading system.
    He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back
worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.
    The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay
to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it
trade in agriculture and services such as banking.
    Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting
marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The
Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet
been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.
    The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove
tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and
many services.
    Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli
pacts ""other countries have realized that if they want to
continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had
better get serious about improving the GATT.""
    The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing
shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially
increase the gross national products in both countries.
    Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should
serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.
    Yeutter said, ""increasing trade is one of the keys to
enhanced political and economic stability around the globe.""
    He said, ""a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only
for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries
that need to increase trade in order to better their standards
of living.""
    Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress
made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to
protectionism.
    He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress
that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions
against nations with large trade surpluses with the United
States if the countries practiced unfair trade.
    The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade
deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still
rising.
    Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to
resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President
Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.
    Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.
    He said, ""President Reagan will veto any bill that contains
serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained.""

<title>BAKER/STOLTENBERG MEETING SOOTHES MARKETS</title>
<author>    By Jonathan Lynn and Anthony Williams</author>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - </dateline>News of a meeting between U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing the
dollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.
    News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great
secrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by
Baker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fears
that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.
    The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two
pfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.
    The announcement of the meeting, also attended by
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneously
in Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York
markets.
    Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies
accepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry
spokesman in Bonn said.
    The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of
1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.
    The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market
reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest
rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that
West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.
    Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to
coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with
the surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating
their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget
deficit.
    West German government sources said rising West German
money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre
pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest
rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising
since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed
raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.
    German yields have also risen over this period, but less
markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up
short-term rates by changing the terms on its security
repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the
money market.
    The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,
compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's
inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,
but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the
Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary
growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,
bank economists said.
    This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the
pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the
more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.
    In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,
the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this
morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.
anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.
    ""They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much
under American fire,"" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at
Swiss Bank Corp here.
    ""It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a
significant retreat from its position,"" added Giles Keating,
economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.
    The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of
the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact
on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market
economists said.
    Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank
does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation
rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,
little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.
    The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication
that the meeting would take place, although the Finance
Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.
    Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to
comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre
accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he
assumed monetary cooperation would continue.
    The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West
Germany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit
Denmark and Belgium.

<title>EX-ARCO &lt;ARC&gt; CHIEF SEES ENERGY CRISIS BY 1990</title>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, Oct 19 - </dateline>Dwindling global crude oil reserves and
the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send
the world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former Atlantic
Richfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.
    ""It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks,"" Anderson
told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. ""I
believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in
two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find.""
    Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil
and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln
barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about
4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.
    ""If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up
one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle
East,"" he said. ""We're soon going to be right back where we
were in 1973 and 1979.""
    Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at
about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.
    ""There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't
enough supply,"" he said. ""There have been no major oil
discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years.""
    Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major world
discovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of
oil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said.

<dateline>    UNITED NATIONS, Oct 19 -</dateline>The United States invoked the right
of self-defense in destroying an Iranian oil platform in the
Gulf, the American delegation told the United Nations.

<title>U.S. LAWMAKERS SUPPORT GULF ACTION</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </dateline>American lawmakers rallied behind
President Reagan for the U.S. strike against Iranian targets in
the Gulf but the attack fueled a sharp new White House-Congress
debate over limits on his powers to make war.
    The Pentagon announced on Monday that U.S. warships
destroyed a non-producing oil platform used for monitoring Gulf
ship traffic and military operations, and also raided a second
Iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack on
a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.
    Many Democrats, who control Congress, and Republicans
expressed support for the attack and praised it as an
appropriate ""measured response.""
    But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that
the growing confrontation between Tehran and the United States
could erupt into a major war, and demanded that Reagan comply
with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of
American forces from the waterway.
    ""Those who contend the strike was necessary must realize
their words are easily construed as a tacit endorsement of war
with Iran,"" said Sen Mark Hatfield of Oregon, a Republican.

events with caution.

<title>DELORS CALLS FOR G-7 MEETING</title>
<dateline>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 19 - </dateline>European Community Commission
President Jacques Delors called for a swift convening of a
meeting of the G-7 countries following the instability in
today's trading on world money and stock markets.
    He told a press conference here: ""G-7 should meet discreetly
and quickly.""
    Delors said if the dollar were to fall further against the
mark to levels around 1.60, the European Monetary System would
undergo a ""test by fire.""
    Delors said the current problems in the markets had been
caused by excessive growth in financial trading, excessive
deregulation and the failure of the fundamentals of the world
economy to adapt themselves quickly enough to changing
circumstances.
    He said it was ""profoundly unjust"" to blame it on recent
increases in West Germany.

met West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl today in West Germany and
agreed to support the Louvre pact, the Treasury Department
said.
    The Treasury described the meeting as ""a very positive,
private meeting in Frankfurt, West Germany which had been
agreed upon last week. ""The parties agreed to continue economic
cooperation under the Louvre agreement and its flexible
application including cooperation on exchange rate stability
and monetary policies,"" the Treasury said.
    The Treasury said Baker and Stoltenberg ""are consulting with
their G-7 colleagues and are confident that this will enable
them to foster exchange rate stability around current levels.""
    The Louvre pact is an agreement between the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries including the United States and
West Germany to promote currency stability.
    Baker was scheduled to visit Scandinavia and Belgium this
week and the department earlier refused to release details of
his travel itinerary, citing security considerations.

<title>U.S. FORCES DESTROYED OIL RIG, RAIDED ANOTHER</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </dateline>U.S. warships destroyed an Iranian oil
platform in the Gulf on Monday and the Navy also raided a
second oil rig in retaliation for Friday's Iranian missile
attack on a U.S. flag tanker, the Pentagon said.
    President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
warned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the military
escalation between the two countries continued in the volatile
waterway.
    Reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform by
four U.S. destroyers, which fired about 1,000 five-inch shells
at the Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central
Gulf.
    A short time later, Navy personnel boarded a second Iranian
oil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radar
and communications equipment before leaving the structure, the
Pentagon said.
     Defense Department spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters

personnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig.
    The United States said both platforms were being used to
keep track of Gulf merchant shipping and to launch speedboat
attacks on such shipping by Iranian Revolutionary guards.

<title>U.S. FORCES DESTROYED OIL RIG, RAIDED ANOTHER</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </dateline>U.S. warships destroyed an Iranian oil
platform in the Gulf on Monday and the Navy also raided a
second oil rig in retaliation for Friday's Iranian missile
attack on a U.S. flag tanker, the Pentagon said.
    President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
warned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the military
escalation between the two countries continued in the volatile
waterway.
    Reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform by
four U.S. destroyers, which fired about 1,000 five-inch shells
at the Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central
Gulf.
    A short time later, Navy personnel boarded a second Iranian
oil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radar
and communications equipment before leaving the structure, the
Pentagon said.
     Defense Department spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters
that the second platform had been abandoned by Iranian
personnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig.
    The United States said both platforms were being used to
keep track of Gulf merchant shipping and to launch speedboat

<title>EC, U.S. PLAN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS</title>
<dateline>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 19 - </dateline>The European Community is willing to
offer limited concessions to the United States on one of two
major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations
next year, an EC commission spokesman said.
    He said the offer would be made at a meeting later this
month between U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and EC
External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq.
    EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agriculture
ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make
some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on U.S.
Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed
with growth hormones, the spokesman said.
    Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC
proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries
do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the
makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming U.S.
Manufacturers.
    It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will
rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year.
    Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting will
take place in London and will also involve the aerospace
ministers of France, Britain, West Germany and Spain, the
countries involved in the Airbus project.

<title>HUGE OIL PLATFORMS DOT GULF LIKE BEACONS</title>
<author>    By ASHRAF FOUAD</author>
<dateline>    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - </dateline>Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like
beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.
    One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,
was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.
    The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and
concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60
metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.
Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.
    The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section
of the structure remained.
    U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an
American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.
forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had
been caught laying mines.
    But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense
officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm
missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday
and the Sea Isle City on Friday.
    Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a
key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.
    Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East
now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti
tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.
    But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level
of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result
of U.S. intervention and Iran's response.
    The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a
U.S. ""tit-for-tat"" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said
Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.
    He said with this appraoch America would suffer ""the death
of one thousand cuts.""
    But for the United States to grab the initiative
militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's
harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its
shipping must pass, Schuler said.
    He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing
Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,
Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.
    Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic
initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an
arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.
    He said the United States should also threaten to mine and
blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to
acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a
settlement.
    Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by
invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the
outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style
infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.
    Each side has attacked the others' shipping.

<title>DIPLOMATS CALL U.S. ATTACK ON OIL RIG RESTRAINED</title>
<author>    By Ian MacKenzie</author>
<dateline>    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - </dateline>A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform
in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid
carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab
allies, Western diplomats in the region said.
    U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that
U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf
in response to a missile strike on the American-registered
Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
    ""We consider the matter closed,"" he said, a signal the U.S.
administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.
    Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day
against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action
would endanger American interests.
    Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War
Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a
""crushing blow.""
    ""The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in
no way get out safely,"" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.
    Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid
ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on
November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.
    Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in
Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in
preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.
    Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab
states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they
said.
    ""The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran to
respond one way or the other,"" a diplomat said.
    President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American
countermeasures if the military escalation continued.
    Western diplomats and military sources in the area said
shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act
the United States could have taken once it had decided to
retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans
and Kuwaitis on Iran.
    ""It's interesting that they chose something in international
waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation,"" one
diplomat said. ""This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf
Arab states, particularly Kuwait.""
    Commented another diplomat: ""Kuwait must be happy that the
U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked
on its doorstep.""
    One source said of the attack on the oil platform: ""They
managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the
least nuisance to everybody.""
    A diplomat commented: ""They were very clever in the place
they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated
anything because it wasn't working in the first place.""
    A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:
""This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up
... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans).""

<title>LATEST ATTACK SEEN POINTING UP DILEMMAS FOR US</title>
<author>    By CHRISTOPHER HANSON</author>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </dateline>Military experts say the United States
faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an
Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a
U.S.-flagged tanker.
    The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is
likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as
long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching
limited retaliatory strikes.
    But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps
-- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or
destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.
    ""Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the
cycle of attack and retaliation continues,"" said Fred Axelgard,
a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS).
    ""It's like a Greek tragedy,"" said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll
of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)
think tank.
    Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for
Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to
the war between Iran and Iraq.
    They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its
30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began
escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal 
would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which
President Reagan could never accept.
    U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon
news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel
fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam
oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf
time (0700 EDT) on Monday.
    Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military
base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian
Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea
Isle City on Friday.
    Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and
allowed to escape.
    ""We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will
be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran
with stronger countermeasures,"" Weinberger said.
    ""We consider this matter closed,"" he said.
    Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives
agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not
escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was
whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken
this view after earlier clashes.

<title>NORTHEAST SAVINGS &lt;NSB&gt; ADOPTS RIGHTS PLAN</title>
<dateline>    HARTFORD, Conn., Oct 19 - </dateline>Northeast Savings F.A. said its
board adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to protect the
company from coercive takeover tactics and bids not fair to all
sharholders.
    Under the plan, the board declared a dividend of one share
purchase right for each of the Northeast common shares held of
record as of November two, the company said.
    Initially, the rights are not exerciseable, rights
certificates are not distributed, and the rights automatically
trade with Northeast's shares, the company said.
    However, 20 days following the acquisition of 20 pct or
more of Northeast's common shares shares or 20 days following
the commencement of a tender offer for 30 pct or more of
Northeast's shares, the rights will become exerciseable and
separate rights certificates will be distributed, the company
said.
    The rights will entitle holders of Northeast's common
shares to purchase additional shares at an exercise price of 60
dlrs a share, the company said.
    The company said that in the event of certain triggering
events described in the rights plan, holders of the rights,
other than an acquiring person, will be entitled to acquire
Northeast's common shares having a market value of twice the
then-current exercise price of the rights. Also, in the event
Northeast enters into certain business combination
transactions, holders of the rights will be provided a right to
acquire equity securities of the acquiring entity having a
market value of twice the then-current exercise price of the
rights, the company said. Northeast said it will be entitled to
redeem the rights at one cent per right until the occurence of
certain events.

<title>SOVIET 1988 GRAIN TARGET INDICATES 1987 OUTPUT</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </dateline>Recent announcements from Moscow of
next year's grain production targets indicate that the Soviets
are estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes,
Agriculture Department analysts said.
    USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but
some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987
grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.
    Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday,
putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of
Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in
Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be
""25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.""
    ""This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213
mln tonne (grain) crop,"" the analyst said.
   
    In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235
mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure
published in a Soviet economic journal this month.
    USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a
range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.
    Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest
progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.
    While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture
official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be
as good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest.
    A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln
tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would
bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.

<title>AMPLE SUPPLIES LIMIT U.S. STRIKE'S OIL PRICE IMPACT</title>
<author>    By Ian Jones</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, Oct 19 - </dateline>Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on
world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains
that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the
Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.
    December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before
falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.
    ""Fundamentals are awful,"" said Philip Lambert, analyst with
stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC
production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln
bpd, little changed from September levels.
    Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC
production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and
International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September
production at 18.5 mln bpd.
    The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of
a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea
Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,
in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag
commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.
    The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the
area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.
    Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on
Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.
Attack, analysts said.
    They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which
around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in
the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.
    Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in
the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf
hostilities, analysts said.
    But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian
missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.
    Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,
said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.
    ""The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond
to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any
further action will be met with a like-for-like response.
Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,"" Pyne said.
    Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was ""a
responsible retaliation,"" with the U.S. Apparently indicating to
Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran
chose to raise the level of conflict.
    Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.
    He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as
Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests
the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a
result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian
retaliation.
    The initial upward market move this morning reflected a
strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which
was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile
launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.
    The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy
attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary
Caspar Weinburger.
    Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the
Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less
serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,
analysts and traders said.

<title>FED'S JOHNSON WARNS AGAINST LOWER DOLLAR</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </dateline>Federal Reserve Board Vice-Chairman
Manuel Johnson cautioned against seeking ""quick-fix solutions"" to
persistent U.S. trade and federal budget deficits.
    In particular, he told an American Stock Exchange
conference, a decline in the dollar below current levels would
exacerbate financial market conditions.
    ""Trying to artificially depress the dollar severely below
current levels ... would exacerbate financial market conditions
and lead to further potential for financial problems.""
    Nowhere, Johnson said, are Fed officials hearing that U.S.
businesses cannot compete at current exchange rates.
    He acknowledged the U.S. trade deficit was persisting
despite a decline in the dollar's value of 40 to 50 pct in the
past two years.
    But the deficit is improving in volume terms and will soon
begin showing improvement.
    ""The stage I think is being set for a healthy, constructive
expansion without inflationary instability,"" he said.

has raised 61 mln European Currency Units (ECUs) which will be
invested in management buy-outs and development capital
opportunities in the U.K. And continental Europe.
    The funds were raised through BCI's first such fund - the
Baring Euaring European Capital Trust - from investors in nine
European countries. It expects to raise another 40 mln ECUs
soon through a French fund and a fund for U.S. Investors.
    BCI was set up last year by Baring Brothers to advise
buy-out and development capital investors.
    BCI said the new fund is structured as a Guernsey-based
unit trust, which will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange. It will be advised by BCI and managed by a company
owned jointly by Barings and the management of BCI.
    Individual investments are expected to range between one

<title>G-7 SEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP CURRENCY PACT</title>
<author>    By Claire Miller</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </dateline>International monetary officials will 
rush to paper over the deep cracks that have appeared in the
Louvre accord on currency stability to prevent a dollar
free-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital markets,
economists and currency traders said.
    ""I don't think the Louvre is dead because if it breaks up
in an acrimonious way, the potential outcome is a rout of the
dollar, higher interest rates and collapsing stock markets.
It's in the Group of Seven's interest to calm things down,""
said Douglas Madison, corporate trader at BankAmerica Corp.
   
    In a weekend television interview, U.S. Treasury secretary
James Baker sharply criticised a recent rise in West German
money market rates and said the eight month-old Louvre pact to
foster exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed.
    His comments rocked the currency markets and helped send
the already-fragile U.S. and overseas stock markets into a
tailspin.
    The dollar lost more than two pfennigs in the U.S. to about
1.7740/50 marks and about one yen to 141.25/35 yen. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 200 points at one

not oppose the slate of nominees proposed for election to the
board by the committee led by Entertainment Marketing Inc &lt;EM&gt;
and the &lt;Oppenheimer-Palmieri Fund, LP.&gt;
    Crazy Eddie said its board is not endorsing, but will
simply refrain from opposing, the EMI-Palmieri nominees.    
The board also said it will ask representatives of the
Committee to Restore Shareholder value to begin acquainting
themselves with the business and affairs of the company as
promptly as possible.
   
    To that end, the committee's representatives will be
invited in advance of the annual meeting to examine the
company's financial records, to monitor its operations and to
join company officers in meetings with the company's suppliers,
bankers and key personnel, Crazy Eddie said.
    The board said that to continue to oppose the EMI-Palmieri
group would only increase the expenses of the company, create
further uncertainty among its suppliers, customers and
employees, and result in deterioration of moral among company
personnel.
    A further release from the company will follow, it said.

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </dateline>The Senate Agriculture Committee was
expected to consider proposals that would limit adjustments in
county loan rate differentials which trigger larger corn and
wheat acreage reduction requirements, Senate staff said.
    A budget-saving proposal drafted by chairman Patrick Leahy
(D-Vt) would limit adjustments in county loan rate
differentials to no more than one pct per year from the
national average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops.
    The plan also would allow the Agriculture Secretary to
increase the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by
""an appropriate amount to generate savings"" if projected corn
stocks exceeded 6.0 billion bushels.
    Leahy's proposal would also allow a larger 1988 wheat set
aside if projected stocks surpassed 1.9 billion bushels.

Studios Inc signed a definitive agreement to merge in a stock
swap value at 115 mln dlrs, based on October 16 closing prices.
    The company said the agreement calls for the holders of
common stock in Hal Roach to exchange their shares on a
one-for-one basis for shares in the combined company.
    It said holders of Robert Halmi common will exchange their
shares on a two-and-one-half-for-one basis for shares in the
combined company.
    The company said the swap will be tax-free.
    The company also said &lt;Qintex Ltd&gt;, a 35 pct owner of Hal
Roach common stock, has agreed to use the company as the
exclusive vehicle for its U.S. media and entertainment
investments, the company said.
    The company said Qintex's U.S. subsidiary also agreed to
supply a minimum 70 mln dlrs line of credit to the new company,
which shall be used, with Qintex approval, for financing new
HRI products.
    The company said that under the definitive agreement,
Qintex's U.S. division will have the right to purchase up to 51
pct of the new company in the open market, in private
transactions or by tender offer, but will not be purchasing
warrants to bring its ownership to 51 pct of the new company.
    If Qintex's U.S. subsidiary has not achieved this ownership
within one year after the completion of the merger, the
subsidiary will have the right two years thereafter to request
that HRI commence a rights offering to HRI stockholders, the
company said.
    Regarding the potential rights offering, Qintex's U.S.
subsidiary will act as standby purchaser, the company said.
    The transaction is subject to the approval of both
company's shareholders, the receipt of certain tax approvals,
and the continued employement of Robert Halmi Sr and Robert
Halmi Jr, the company said.
    Robert Halmi Sr, who is currently chairman and chief
executive officer of Robert Halmi Inc, will be chairman of the
new company and David Evans, current president and chief

<title>TRANSATLANTIC ROW IMPERILS LOUVRE ACCORD-DEALERS</title>
<author>    By Guy Collins</author>
<dateline>    PARIS, Oct 19 - </dateline>The Louvre accord on currency stability,
which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since
last February, appeared in serious danger today as a
transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to
the boil, foreign exchange dealers said.
    But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and
bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial
countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem
between the United States and West Germany and insisted that
the currency pact was still alive.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market
fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term
interest rates. ""That's not in keeping with the spirit of what
we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,""
Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was
referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group
of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the
pact.
    Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both
have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic
growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.
Agreed to stop talking the dollar down.
    However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre
agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate
move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.
    ""The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that
he's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets
are off in terms of currency cooperation,"" Chris Johns, currency
analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.
    But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine
view, telling Reuters that ""the exchange market is apparently
reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker
comment will regret it later on.""
    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the
Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to
respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for ""a faithful
and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the
Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit.""
    Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British
Treasury commented on the row.
    But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite
U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, ""this does
not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the
Louvre Accord.""
    In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive
of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that
following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.
Was still committed to the accord.
    In a move which the market interpreted as a possible
gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term
liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on
Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected
medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also
stepped into the French money market to hold down rates,
injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose
close to eight pct.

<title>UK SUGAR FACTORY CLOSES DUE TO SHORTAGE OF BEET</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, Oct 19 - </dateline>British Sugar Plc was forced to shut its
Ipswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acute
shortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to a
Reuter inquiry
    Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combination
of very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in the
factory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week's
hurricane which blocked roads.
    The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are
cleared and supplies of beet build up again.
    This is the first time in many years that a factory has
been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.
    Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,
but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.
    Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British
Sugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year
out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.
    Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting
problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining
its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2
mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the
spokesman said.
    British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.
    The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,
is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories
normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the
campaign.
    As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been
harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13
pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather has
severely restricted beet lifting.
    Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yet
available.

<dateline>    MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., Oct 19 - </dateline>International Multifoods Corp
said it filed a suit charging Bregman Partners and its
affiliates unlawfully planned to acquire control of the
company.
    In a suit filed in U.S. District Court, International
Multifoods said Bregman Partners and its affiliates, who
reportedly hold 7.4 pct of the company's shares, tried to
induce Multifood's management to join them in an effort to take
the company private and give controlling interest to Bregman
Partners. Bregman Partners include the interests of the
Belzberg families of Canada.
    The complaint also discloses that on each occasion,
Multifoods management rejected the group's overtures.
    Multifoods is asking Bregman's group to divest its shares
in open market sales in a manner not to further disrupt the
market place, according to the suit. The suit seeks
compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be
determined.
    In addition, Multifoods is seeking to stop Bregman Partners
from acquiring any more stock, or voting the shares it
reportedly owns, the suit said.
    According to Multifoods, the actions proposed by Bregman
Partners would prevent shareholders from realizing the full
benefits of the company's restructuring.
    In the past three years, Multifoods has substantially
altered its domestic business mix by divesting its U.S.
consumere foods operations and emphasizing growth in selected
segments of the U.S. foodservice industry.

<title>WORLD TELECOMS WATCHDOG RELAXES CAR PHONE RULES</title>
<dateline>    GENEVA, Oct 19 - </dateline>The International Telecommunications
Union, which regulates communications worldwide, decided at the
end of a five-week conference to allow mobile phone systems to
be linked with satellites, telecommunications officials said.
    Until now, car phones have been linked with land stations
and have been limited mainly to urban areas. The new ruling
will make it easier for calls to be made from remote regions.
    The meeting, which finished over the weekend, also decided
to allow a ""radio determination satellite system,"" which would
enable fleet owners to trace to within about 15 metres the
movements of their lorries or cars or ships around the world.

<title>IDC SERVICES &lt;IDCS.O&gt; HOLDERS OFFERED 16 DLRS</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </dateline>IDC Services Inc said a new company will
begin a cash tender offer by October 26 to acquire all of IDC's
outstanding common for 16 dlrs a share.
    The company said the offer is being made under a definitive
agreement reached with the new company, IDC Acquisition Corp,
formed by Apollo Partners Ltd and investment clients of
&lt;Equitable Capital Management Inc&gt;. The agreement calls for the
acquisition of IDC for about 62.4 mln dlrs.
    IDC Acquisition will also tender for all of IDC's
outstanding nine pct convertible subordinated debentures.
   
    IDC said the merger agreement also provides for payment of
an equivalent amount in respect of employee stock options to be
cancelled in the merger.
    As part of the transaction, the company said, it granted
IDC Acquisition an option to acquire up to 20 pct of the
company's outstanding shares for 16 dlrs per share.
    It said the planned tender offer is subject to several
conditions, including the tendering of over 50 pct of the
company's outstanding stock.
   
    MIM Holdings Ltd &lt;MIMA.S&gt;, a substantial shareholder in
IDC, has agreed it will not buy any additional IDC shares until
February seven and has granted IDC Acquisition a right of first
refusal on any IDC shares it sells during that period, the
company said.
    It said Apollo Partners was recently organized by three
former senior Viacom Inc &lt;VIA&gt; executives, Terrence A. Elkes,
George C. Catell and Kenneth F. Gorman.

<title>IC INDUSTRIES &lt;ICX&gt; MAY SELL AEROSPACE UNIT</title>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, Oct 19 - </dateline>IC Industries Inc said its board approved
a second major step in the reorganization and restructuring of
the company.
    To implement the plan of sharpening its strategic focus on
consumer goods and services, the company will give serious
consideration to the sale of its Pneumo Abex, its aerospace and
defense company, if it can realize a price which will return
maximum value to shareholders.
    In 1986, Pneumo Abex had operating income of 118.1 mln dlrs
on sales of 900.5 mln dlrs.
    IC said it will use the proceeds of any asset sale to
invest in new high-return businesses in the consumer goods and
services field.
    The company said it authorized a program to repurchase
between 500 mln dlrs and 1.0 billion dlrs of IC's common stock
from time to time when conditions warrant.
    It also said it will begin an immediate cost-reduction
program to cust annual operating expenses by 50 mln dlrs.
    An IC spokesman said the cost-reduction program involved
""across-the-board"" cuts rather than specific about targeted
areas.
    IC's board earlier approved a plan to spin off the
company's Illinois Central Gulf Railroad to shareholders. The
company's other major subsidiaries are Pet Inc, Pepsi-Cola
General Bottlers, Midas International Corp and Hussmann Corp.

<title>CAIRNS GROUP SAID INFLUENTIAL IN TRADE TALKS</title>
<dateline>    BANGKOK, Oct 19 - </dateline>Australian Minister for Trade
Negotiations Michael Duffy said his country and Third World
commodity producers have formed an effective lobby group
against farm export subsidies and market access restrictions.
    Duffy told a press conference the Cairns Group of 14 major
agricultural producers, to which Australia and Thailand belong,
has emerged as an important third force in any multilateral
trade talks. ""There's no doubt that the Cairns Group is being
seen as a third force to be reckoned with both inside the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in other
international trade negotiations,"" he said.
    Duffy, here on a three-day visit after talks in the United
States, The European Community (EC) and Latin America, said
considerable progress has been made by the group towards
fighting costly protectionist policies pursued by developed
countries.
    The minister said the EC Commission's new farm trade paper
will recognise the heavy financial burdens imposed by its
Common Agricultural Policy and its future expansion.
    He said the Reagan Administration has also displayed a
determination to resist the currently strong protectionist
sentiment in the U.S. Congress.

<title>U.S. NAVAL FORCES ATTACK IRANIAN OIL PLATFORM</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </dateline>U.S. warships attacked and destroyed
an Iranian oil platform on Monday in retaliation for Friday's
Iranian attack damaging a U.S.-flagged ship, U.S. Defense

Weinberger said, ""Nothing.""
    ""There was no Iranian reaction,"" he said. ""... We consider
this matter is now closed.""
    Weinberger said four U.S. destroyers attacked the platform
about 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central Gulf with fire
at 0700 EDT, Weinberger said.
    ""We chose a platform used by the Iranians to interfere with
and be a source of potential attack on convoys...,"" Weinberger
said at a Pentagon briefing. 
    ""We know it has been used indeed, to not only launch small
boat attacks on shipping but to fire on U.S. helicopters...
    ""It's removal will contribute significantly to the safety of
U.S. forces in the future,"" Weinberger said of the U.S. Navy's
operation to escort oil tankers through the Gulf.
    ""We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will
be prepared to meet any escalation of military actions by Iran
with stronger countermeasures,"" Weinberger said.
    He said the 20 to 30 Iranian personnel on the oil platform
were given a 20-minute warning to abandon the platform.
    ""As far as we know they did abandon the site,"" he said.
    Weinberger was asked why the United States had chosen to
attack an oil platform rather than Iranian Silkworm missile
platforms blamed by Washington for Friday's attack.

its subsidiary &lt;Hong Kong Telephone Co Ltd&gt; would cease to be a

Kong units.
    Earlier today the company announced that Hong Kong
Telephone and Cable and Wireless Hong Kong, in which the
territory's government has a 20 pct stake, would become
subsidiaries of a newly formed holding company, Hong Kong
Telecommunications.
    In exchange for the Cable and Wireless Hong Kong capital,
Hong Kong Telecommunications will issue 4.18 billion new shares
to Cable and Wireless Plc's Cable and Wireless (Far East) Ltd.
    That subsidiary now holds the group's 80 pct stake in Cable
and Wireless Hong Kong and about 22 pct of H.K. Telephone.
    It will issue an additional 1.05 billion shares to the
goverment.
    That will leave the Cable and Wireless group with an 80 pct
stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications, the government 11 pct
and nine pct in public hands.
    But that will be reduced early next year after a placement
of 11 pct of the issued shares of Hong Kong Telecommunications
by both Cable and Wireless and the government.

    On September 8, the group offered 64.00 dlrs in cash and

debentures due 2007 for each GAF share.  Heyman owns about

    In a letter to the committee of independent directors
formed to consider the offer, Heyman said it will have to
modify the terms of the offer if it is to continue the bid, due
to rising interest rates and financial market conditions.
    Heyman said ""In the considerable time that has elapsed
since our original proposal was submitted, the credit and
financial markets have experienced extraordinary and almost
unprecedented deterioration.  As of the present time, the
average interest rate on the financing which we proposed to
raise in connection with the acquisition has increased, since
the original proposal, by approximately 150 basis points.""

<title>AIRCRAFT ATTACK IRANIAN OIL RIGS IN SOUTHERN GULF</title>
<dateline>    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - </dateline>Unidentified jets attacked three Iranian
oil rigs in the southern Gulf early on Monday, setting at least
one of them ablaze, regional shipping sources said.
    Earlier today in Washington, U.S. Television networks had
reported that American forces launched a retaliatory strike
against Iran late Sunday, attacking two Iranian offshore oil
drilling platforms and setting them ablaze.
    The shipping sources said Iran's Sassan, Rostam and Rakhsh
offshore oilfields were attacked at 0700 local (0300 GMT) by a
wave of jet fighter bombers. Smoke was seen spiralling up from
the Rostam field soon after.
    At least one of the other two targets was also believed to
be ablaze, the sources said.
    The Sassan and Rostam fields have been targets for Iraqi
air strikes in the past, but Baghdad had not reported any
southern Gulf missions prior to news of the latest attack.
    Shipping and military sources in the region have said Iran
used its southern Gulf rigs as bases to launch helicopter and
later speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the waterway.
    U.S. Officials had been meeting on a response since Friday
when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a
U.S.-flagged ship. President Reagan said on Sunday he had
already made a decision on the U.S. Response to Friday's Iran
attack but would not say what the decision was.

attack on a U.S.-flagged ship in Kuwaiti waters on Friday was
almost certainly by an Iran Silkworm missile.

<title>SOUTH YEMEN PLANS OIL EXPORT PIPELINE - MEES</title>
<dateline>    NICOSIA, Oct 19 - </dateline>South Yemen is planning a major oil
pipeline system to be completed in 18-months time to start
exports at a initial rate of 100,000 barrels per day, (bpd) the
Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said.
    MEES said government approval for the export pipeline
followed a visit to Aden by a high ranking delegation from the
Soviet Union, which will help South Yemen construct the line
    The engineering studies for the pipeline are nearly
finished and construction is expected to start early next year,
the industry newsletter said.
    The pipeline will run about 170-200 kms (105-125 miles)
from Shabwa oilfields to a coastal terminal at Bir 'Ali on the
Gulf of Aden, MEES said.
     MEES said the Soviet firm Technoexport, which is
developing oilfileds for South Yemen, has substantially
increased its initial reserve estimates and recommended a
pipeline with an eventual 500,000 bpd capacity.
    The discovery of commercial quaotities of oil was confirmed
by Technoexport earlier this year in three structures in the
Shabwa region in the Northwestern part of the country, 200 kms
east of North Yemen's Alif oilfield.

<title>GERMAN FINANCIAL POLICY MAKERS IN RARE DISSENSION</title>
<author>    By Jonathan Lynn</author>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - </dateline>Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's
central bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are
normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the
central bank's independence.
    But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,
president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a
controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of
the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.
    Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last
Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and
interest rates
    Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's
criticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place
for foreign investors.
    ""The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and
Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign
investors,"" said one economist for a London broker, who asked
not to be identified.
    Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial
policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to
steer the economy through a particularly difficult time.
    ""There are plenty of objective pressures which will result
in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill
feeling,"" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.
    News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct
withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in
a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and
abroad.
    Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the
finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the
Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting
details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.
    Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under
extraordinary pressures lately.
    Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his
deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight
inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had
pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.
    In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like
Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been
warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply
growth would eventually lead to rising prices.
    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank
council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his
views, bankers said.
    ""Poehl is in a minority in his own house,"" said Commerzbank's
Pfister.
    ""Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not
entirely his own,"" said another economist.
    The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,
they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark
and hurting West German exporters.
    The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the
Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.
    Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James
Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.
    Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986
war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.
Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to
stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.
    One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round
of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.
    But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for
Stoltenberg than he had bargained for.
    The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted
most popular government politician last year, had to face
resistance from local barons in the government coalition
parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.
    The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising
4.3 billion marks.
    But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will
push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the
government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.
    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row
which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.
    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last
month early to sort out a row in the northern state of
Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.
    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after
allegations of a ""dirty tricks"" election campaign led to heavy
losses for the CDU in state elections.
    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last
weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.
    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more
remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and
was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this
year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government
gave Poehl another eight-year term.
    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he
hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.
    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was
not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the
Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.

currently well below the annual inflation rate of 33.2 pct.
    But the sources said he ran into opposition from Finance

<title>BALLADUR INSISTS ON MAINTENANCE OF LOUVRE ACCORDS</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, Oct 19 - </dateline>French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
issued a firm call for the continued faithful application of
the Louvre accords on currency stability by all major
industrial countries.
    Balladur, responding to weekend remarks by U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker that the U.S. Would take another look at
the accords, said ""I firmly desire a faithfull and firm
adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre
accords -- in both their letter and spirit.""
    On Sunday, Baker said last week's rise in short-term West
German interest rates was not in keeping with the accords.

    The Louvre accords, agreed in Paris last February, called
for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged
dollar slide.
    The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance
Ministers in Washington last month.
    But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate
rise was ""not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to.""
    ""What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to
simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their
part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow
them,"" he added.

<title>CHINA FORECASTS 397 MLN TONNES GRAIN HARVEST</title>

397 mln tonnes, eight mln tonnes short of its target, the New
China News Agency quoted a State Statistical Bureau spokesman
as saying.
    The harvest will be China's second highest in history but
poor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmers
have kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said.
    Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mln
tonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall.
    Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mln
tonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09
mln in the same 1986 period.
    Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state prices
for grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increase
the incentive for grain production.
    China could not afford to become a major food importer, he
said.
    The State Statistics Bureau spokesman also said China's
1987 cotton output was expected to rise 10 pct over 1986 to 390

<title>SOVIET SUGAR CONSUMPTION UP AS HOME BREWING GROWS</title>
<dateline>    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - </dateline>A sharp rise in Soviet sugar consumption
since the start of the Kremlin's anti-alcohol drive indicates
home brewing is costing the state 20 billion roubles in lost
vodka sales, Pravda said.
    The Communist Party newspaper said sugar sales had
increased by one mln tonnes a year, enough to be turned into
two billion bottles of moonshine.
    At current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle, it said,
this meant illicit alcohol consumption had reached the
equivalent of 20 billion roubles a year, or annual revenues
from vodka sales before the May 1985 anti-alchohol decree.
    ""Official statistics show a reduction in consumption of
vodka, but this is a deceptive statistic -- it does not count
home-brew,"" Pravda said.
    ""The epidemic first engulfed the villages and has now also
firmly settled into cities, where the availability of natural
gas, running water and privacy has made it much easier.""
    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol
campaign shortly after taking office in March 1985 as a first
step to improving Soviet economic performance, which had been
seriously hurt by drunkenness among the working population.

    Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier

Statoil's semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating
production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed
well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said.
    Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S

well-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand

    Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a
fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field
partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several
months earlier than previously planned.
    Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln
barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km
west of Bergen.
    Statoil estimates the field's total development cost,

    Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg

Norway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields.

<title>LOUVRE ACCORD STILL IN EFFECT, JAPAN OFFICIAL SAYS</title>
<author>    By Kunio Inoue</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - </dateline>The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations
still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize
currencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.
    And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the
weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower
range for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank of
Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.
    ""The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and
anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it
later on,"" the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.
    The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the
dollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he
noted.
    A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in
monetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would
never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar
against the mark or the yen.
    The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between
140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.
    The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and
141.35 yen.
    ""Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higher
interest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this
does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework
of the Louvre accord,"" the Finance Ministry official said.
    He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any
further rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only
hurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt
problem.
    Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their
interest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets
further, the monetary officials said.
    Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined
to be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further
decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary
expectations in the U.S.
    ""That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre
agreement is still operative,"" the senior ministry official
said.
    Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that
Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West
Germany's increase in short-term interest rates.
    The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.
Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar
decline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,
try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the
accord, foreign exchange dealers said.
    But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional
statement that ""the Louvre agreement is still operative,"" and
this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the
dealers said.
    Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in
Tokyo currency markets.
    The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised
pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates
higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,
or international economic policy coordination.
    The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other's
economic policies and from time to time apply ""peer pressure"" to
persuade others to change their policies to a desired course,
they noted. ""Without such a basic agreement of multilateral
surveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German
policy so openly,"" the ministry official said.
    The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy
should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy
coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse
of the Louvre agreement, the official said.
    He also said Japan has not received any specific request
from the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term
money rates have been edging higher.
    ""This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking
policy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate
rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons,"" he
added.

<title>BALLADUR INSISTS ON MAINTENANCE OF LOUVRE ACCORDS</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, Oct 19 - </dateline>French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
issued a firm call for the continued faithful application of
the Louvre accords on currency stability by all major
industrial countries.
    Balladur, responding to weekend remarks by U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker that the U.S. Would take another look at
the accords, said ""I firmly desire a faithfull and firm
adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre
accords -- in both their letter and spirit.""
    On Sunday, Baker said last week's rise in short-term West
German interest rates was not in keeping with the accords.
    The Louvre accords, agreed in Paris last February, called
for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged
dollar slide.
    The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance
Ministers in Washington last month.
    But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate
rise was ""not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to.""
    ""What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to
simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their
part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow
them,"" he added.

<title>ECONOMIST URGES MORE TAXES TO LOWER N.Z. DOLLAR</title>
<dateline>    WELLINGTON, Oct 19 - </dateline>An income tax surcharge and capital
gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of
the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.
    Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the
Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to
restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by
current government policies.
    The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn
would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.
He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could
be much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.
    Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a
percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was
probably unavoidable, Bayliss said.
    He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct
value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,
but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.
Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary
impact of a currency depreciation.
    The government had failed to bring inflation down despite
lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.
    New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to
end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.
    The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation
policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and
insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss
said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt
and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.
    ""The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are
going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought
is soundly based -- primarily because the government's
macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,"" Bayliss said.

<title>NEW ZEALAND IMPOSES SANCTIONS AGAINST FIJI</title>
<dateline>    WELLINGTON, Oct 19 - </dateline>New Zealand has imposed sanctions
against Fiji in response to that country's change of status to
a republic, acting prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said.
    The sanctions will end all military cooperation and cut
economic aid. New Zealand will also not renew an agreement
which supports the price of Fijian sugar when it expires in
March. The loss of aid and sugar supports will cost Fiji about
10 mln dlrs a year.
    Palmer told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
government had asked High Commissioner Rod Gates to return from
Suva for discussions about other possible measures.
    ""We won't be reacting further until these discussions with
the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister have been held,""
Palmer said.
    The sanctions were approved by the cabinet soon after
Colonel Sitivene Rabuka staged his second coup on September 25.
Implementation was postponed in the hope that Rabuka might turn
back from declaring a republic.
    Palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from
Commonwealth leaders in Vancouver that Fiji's membership of the
Commonwealth had lapsed. Prime Minister David Lange is in
Hawaii on his way home from Vancouver.

<title>IRAN, SOVIET UNION TO SWAP CRUDE, REFINED PRODUCTS</title>
<dateline>    NICOSIA, Oct 19 - </dateline>The Soviet Union has agreed to supply
Iran with refined oil products in exchange for 100,000 barrels
per day of crude, Iran's national news agency, IRNA, said.
    IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza
Aqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that the
agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed
during his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet
Union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said.
    Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility
studies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in
southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union.
    Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of
its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf.
    Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet
Union, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he
left for Moscow.
    Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf
war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined
products.
    Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered at
the Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr, at Neka, near the
Caspian, and at Jolfa in north-west Iran.

<title>TOKYO DEALERS SEE DOLLAR POISED TO BREACH 140 YEN</title>
<author>    By Rie Sagawa</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - </dateline>Tokyo's foreign exchange market is watching
nervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below the
significant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.
    ""The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is
considered to be the lower end of the reference range. If the
currency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,""
said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.
    The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Friday
closes of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.
    The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of
140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New York
and 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.
    The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.
    ""The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish
sentiment after Baker's comments,"" said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. He
said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among
the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the
Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.
    The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day
drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness
in U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.
    Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he
strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest
rates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience
with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord
due to their fears of increasing inflation.
    Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary
pressures also slow domestic demand.
    West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to
boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade
deficit, Tanaka said.
    U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still
massive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest
rates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.
    ""Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations
coordinate dollar buying intervention,"" said Soichi Hirabayashi,
deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange
department.
    The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally
considered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.
    ""The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near
future and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nations
failing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvre
accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,""
Hirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as low
as 135 yen soon.
