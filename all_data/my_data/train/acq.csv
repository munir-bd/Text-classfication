<title>CHEMLAWN &lt;CHEM&gt; RISES ON HOPES FOR HIGHER BIDS</title>
<author>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </dateline>ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM&gt; could attract a
higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste
Management Inc &lt;WNX&gt;, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.
    Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in
over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1
mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.
    ""This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,
maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing
bidder,"" an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,
announced before the opening today, expires March 25.
    ""This is totally by surprise,"" said Debra Strohmaier, a
ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly
scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management
announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not
certain when it would be ready. 
    She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact
between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.
    ""I think they will resist it,"" said Elliott Schlang,
analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. ""Any company that
doesn't like a surprise attack would.""
    Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender
offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn
could try to find a white knight if does not want to be
acquired by Waste Management.
    Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said
ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM&gt; or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL&gt; were
examples of companies that could be interested.
    ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.
company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and
herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of
wastes.
    Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to
another company that wants to capitalize on a strong
residential and commercial distribution system.
    Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had
catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but
the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.
    Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the
fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for
the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.
    Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of
individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.

<title>AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP&gt; SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF</title>
<author>    By Patti Domm, Reuter</author>
<dateline>    New York, Feb 26 - </dateline>American Express Co remained silent on
market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be
considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market
value of its stock.
    American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the
market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a
good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American
Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial
services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.
    American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at
72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.
    American Express would not comment on the rumors or its
stock activity.
    Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'
meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement
yesterday of management changes.
    At the meeting, company officials said American Express
stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance
of Shearson, according to analysts.
    Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief
operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of
president, which had been vacant. It also created four new
positions for chairmen of its operating divisions.
    Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most
sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total
spinoff.
    Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of
Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for
American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last
year.
    ""I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is
going to sell shearson,"" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.
He questioned what would be a better investment than ""a very
profitable securities firm.""
    Several analysts said American Express is not in need of
cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong
asset.
    But others believe the company could very well of
considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one
rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.
    Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he
believes American Express could have considered a partial
spinoff in the past.
    ""Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a
big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in
the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would
probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market
capitalization,"" said Eckenfelder.
    Some analysts said American Express could use capital since
it plans to expand globally.
    ""They have enormous internal growth plans that takes
capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to
enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the
road,"" said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.
    ""They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily
in the future, which goes heavily into the international
arena,"" said Lewis. ""...That does not preclude acquisitions and
divestitures along the way,"" he said.
    Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the
brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might
better reflect other assets, such as the travel related
services business.
    ""It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure
to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a
higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of
the total operating earnings of the company,"" he said.
     Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax
operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.

<title>WALLENBERGS FIGHT BID FOR SWEDISH MATCH STAKE</title>
<dateline>    STOCKHOLM, March 2 - </dateline>Sweden's Wallenberg group fought back
a bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to
secure a large stake in Swedish Match &lt;SMBS ST&gt;, one of the
companies at the core of their business empire.
    A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB
Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken
over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33
pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match.
    Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier &lt;NOBL ST&gt;, in which
Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market
price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said.
    Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at
424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting
rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for
the free shares.
    The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to
49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital
while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights
and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match.
    The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously
amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company.
    The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400
mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most
expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years
to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators.
    The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms
and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo
&lt;VOLV ST&gt; out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco
&lt;ASTS ST&gt; and Stora Koppabergs &lt;SKPS ST&gt;.
    Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest
shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST&gt; by Skanska AB &lt;SKBS ST&gt; and
Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them.
    Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also
managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg
company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB &lt;ALFS ST&gt;.
    During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on
building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent
any raid on the heart of their business empire.
    But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the
electrical engineering firm ASEA AB &lt;ASEA ST&gt; is also too small
at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing
speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe
interests to protect its core activities.

agreed in principle to buy an 80 pct stake in &lt;RMJ Holdings
Corp&gt; for about 79 mln dlrs.
    Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition was
being made from Bank of New York Co Inc &lt;BK.N&gt;, which currently
holds a 50.1 pct, and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder.
    Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct
each and these stakes will be bought over the next six years.
    RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities, one of the
largest U.S. Government securities brokers.
    It is also involved in broking notes, obligations and other
instruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies.
    Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S.
Government securities broker for the past four years and had
made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp
&lt;SPC.N&gt; in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs.
    B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would be
bought at about the same multiple as Exco, suggesting net
income of around 16 mln dlrs.
    The company's earnings had not been hit by the halving of
brokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled.
    Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people, with 200 in
the brokerage business and about 70 in its &lt;SMS&gt; unit, which
provided computer software for the financial services
community.
    RMJ Securities had offices in New York, where total market
turnover of U.S. Government securities was 110 billion dlrs a

    It was also given permission last week to open an office in

<title>AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP&gt; VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS</title>
<author>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </dateline>American Express Co, rumored to be
considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc,
said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit
that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet
broadening international competition.
    In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said
the actions under consideration are an integral part of
American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and
that the two companies have been having both internal and
external discussions on the matters.
    American Express said no decision has been reached on the
strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately
decide to follow growth plans already in place.
    Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the
financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of
Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering
selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the
speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of
the profitable brokerage firm to the public.
    There was some speculation that American Express had also
considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was
considered highly unlikely, analysts said.
     American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it
will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman
would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained
silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American
Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it
to a Friday close at 74.
     It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a
similar statement was being circulated to employees.
    Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for
American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned
brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50
pct in the last year.
    Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning
off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock
price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.
     Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express'
1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.
    American Express' ambitious plans for international growth
may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part
of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of
Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.
    To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.
""(American) Express is in a position where they can raise
capital if they need to,"" said Larry Eckenfelder of
Prudential-Bache Securities.
    Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of
Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey
Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.
     The reorganization also created four new positions for
chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts
speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.
     Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does
little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does
confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which
unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major
acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for
growth and positioning in the global market competition.
    Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F.
Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said
there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when
it approached another major Wall Street brokerage.

<title>PUROLATOR &lt;PCC&gt; IN BUYOUT WITH HUTTON &lt;EFH&gt;</title>
<author>    By Patti Domm</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </dateline>New Jersey-based overnight messenger
Purolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired for
about 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc
and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business.
    Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for
some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a
takeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from
another courier company.
    Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group
Inc, will be majority owner of the company.
    Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, is
paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stock
in a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares
will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a
subsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator's U.S.
courier operations.
    If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholders
would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in
debentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC
Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations.
    Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln
dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC
Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of
the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued
the warrants at two to three dlrs per share.
    Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday.
While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid
30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs.
    This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed
recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for
170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business.
    Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure
caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the
firm is reviewing its options on Stant.
    Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its
U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past
several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet.
    E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to
complete the transaction. This so-called ""bridge"" financing
will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the
form of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to
keeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said.
    ""Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years
largely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe the
management is turning around. We belive it will be a very
serious competitor in the future,"" said Idsal.
    William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courier
division, will be chief executive officer of the new company.
    The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two
thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to
the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions.
    The offer will begin Thursday, subject to clearances from
the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission and will expire
20 business days after commencement unless extended.

<title>REDSTONE DETAILS SWEETENED VIACOM &lt;VIA&gt; OFFER</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </dateline>Investor Sumner Redstone, who leads
one of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International
Inc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a
share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements
Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash
portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.
    Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock
he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.
    The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal
Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that
purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a
share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover.
    Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids
from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom
management which is competing with Redstone for control of the
company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom.
    The company did not disclose the details of the revised
offers, but said a special committee of its board would review
them later today.
    The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom,
and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both
agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is
completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for
at least half of the outstanding stock.
    The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements,
which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided
they keep the information secret.
    In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of
completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of
America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs.
    Besides the financing it would raise through a bank
syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a
separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial
financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs,
Redstone said.
    Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased
its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated
financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs
it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said.
    Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln
dlrs in equity toward the takeover.
    The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would
consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common shares
and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said.
    The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone has
proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also
contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said.
    Last week, the management group submitted what it called
its last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and
consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valued
at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company. Redstone's
previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs.

<title>TALKING POINT/VIACOM INTERNATIONAL &lt;VIA&gt;</title>
<author>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </dateline>A bidding war for Viacom International
Inc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a
management group and other investors against National
Amusements Inc, a closely held theater operator.
    Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source
close to the management side insisted that timing was on his
side. He said if outside directors approve the management
proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders
with proxy material going out late this week. ""It would take 20
days from the day we mail,"" said the source.
    The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by
investor Sumner Redstone, would need ""half a year"" to complete
a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must
accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses
and cable television franchises.
    Redstone was not available for comment.
    Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare
situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One
said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and
if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to
the Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.
    The independent directors of Viacom were called into a
meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.
    Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One
major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. ""We think
we're at the end now, in terms of bidding,"" said the firm's
arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.
    Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would
create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The
management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5
billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred
stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.
    Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,
a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a
value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock
stock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity
interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated
the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the
total package worth 52 dlrs per share.
    Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable
preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of
convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion
was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.
    Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he
would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond
April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The
plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct
during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered
eight pct interest.
    Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management
group, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,
were offering high prices. ""Redstone really wants to own the
company,"" one said. Another said management seemed to have the
edge on the timing issue.
    Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares.
    A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what
the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He
noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp &lt;FMC&gt;, which
adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally
traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now
just over 30 dlrs.
    Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two
two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs
from several acquisitions affected results.
    Shares of Warner Communications Inc &lt;WCI&gt; rose 7/8 to
31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25
mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at
37.50 dlrs.
    Chris Craft Industries &lt;CCN&gt;, which owns a stake in Warner,
rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4.
    Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc &lt;CBS&gt;.
The company has 940,000 cable television subscribers, operates
nine satellite television services and owns television and
radio stations. It is one of the largest distributors of films

<title>PESCH SEES SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT IN AMI &lt;AMI&gt; BID</title>
<author>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    New york, March 2 - </dateline>Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch said he
has had discussions with several American Medical International
Inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the
company.
    Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlr
takeover bid for American Medical with several large
shareholders, including the biggest investor, the Bass family
of Texas. However, the Bass family has not indicated support
one way or the other for his offer, he said.
    Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on the
conversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage
whether he had majority support. He said, however, there is
support for his offer.
    Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held
discussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc,
the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical
stock.
    Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, 
said it held discussions with Pesch, American Medical
management and other American Medical shareholders.
    Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said it believes a restructuring of American
Medical and its business would be ""highly desirable and
appropriate at this time.""
    ""That's the sort of position that I find a large segment of
shareholders of AMI really share,"" said Pesch.
    Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his
takeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four
dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each
American Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join in
an effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would not
rule out a future takeover try.
    Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal
with the Bass family.
    Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch's
takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some
shareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical's
previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from
Pesch.
    American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid.
Larry Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a
management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out.
    An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment
on the new Pesch offer by March 10.
    Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in
the outcome of the bid for control of American Medical.
    The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in American
Medical, and the company has previously said the investors
support management's internal plan to improve the company's
performance. The Bass family would not comment on American
Medical or Pesch.
    Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp
last year, continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall
Street because of the long time it took to finish the Republic
acquisition.
    Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall
street questioning whether financing can be completed for the
much larger American Medical takeover proposal.
    Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made without
an investment banking firm, another cause for concern to Wall
Street. However, Pesch entered his second offer with
representation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities
and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group.
    ""I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be
worked out and completed, provided we get to the point where
Ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly
environment,"" Pesch said.
    Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing
arrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in
acquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American
Medical management in place.
    He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to
form an efficient network of hospitals.
    Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could
be made for American Medical.
    Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved second
fiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth
about 20 dlrs per share.
    Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second
quarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct
loss last year.
    Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much more
than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously.
    But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction
could be completed because of the revised structure of the
offer. ""I think it's much more doable,"" he said.
    Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround
by replacing some members of management and reducing costs.

Purolator Courier Corp by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and a management
group from Purolator's courier division.
    There had been speculation another offer might be

price being paid by Hutton and the managers' PC Acquisition Inc

another bidder would emerge since Purolator had been for sale
for sometime before a deal was struck with Hutton Friday.
    Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It
had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on
Friday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company
might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
    analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive
offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for
sometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday.
    Hutton had been in talks with Purolator's adviser, Dillon,
Read and Co since late December, a Hutton spokesman said.
    Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the
shares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive
29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock in
a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S.
courier operation. Hutton values the warrants at two to three
dlrs per share.
    Wall Street sources also said today that a rival bidder

<title>SEC PROBES 1986 TRE &lt;TRE&gt; TAKEOVER ATTEMPT</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </dateline>The federal Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) is looking for possible securities laws
violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by
Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp,
attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said.
    During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's Giant
Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE.
    It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a Los
Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a
portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired.
    In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln
dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of the
proceeds to buy TRE stock.
    Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six
pct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing.
    The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SEC
was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE
holdings were working together without disclosing their
cooperation, as would be required by the federal securities
laws.
    One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether
Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its
intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln
dlr bond offering.
    A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE, since December a unit
of Aluminum Co of America, had been contacted by SEC
investigators and was cooperating with the probe.
    The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler had
been interviewed by the SEC probers.
    A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked for
information a few months ago as part of an informal probe.
    The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agency
and had heard nothing more since that time.
    ""To the best of our knowledge, Jefferies is not the target
of a formal SEC investigation"" in connection with the TRE bid,
he said.
    A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm had
underwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added:
    ""We had nothing to do with TRE.""
    As a matter of policy, the SEC routinely declines to
comment on its enforcement activities.

<title>HK HOTELS SOARS ON TAKEOVER SPECULATION</title>
<dateline>    HONG KONG, March 3 - </dateline>The price of Hongkong and Shanghai
Hotels Ltd &lt;SHLH.HK&gt;'s stock soared on speculation of a
takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family
and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd &lt;EVGH.HK&gt; group, stock
brokers said.
    They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an
announcement by Evergo's &lt;China Entertainment and Land
Investment Co Ltd&gt; unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk
Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06
billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today.
    Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined comment
on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels.
But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought
from Liang as long term investment.
    He said Evergo ""was attracted by the underlying strength of
Hk Hotels.""
    Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible
redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best known
hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by
Hk Hotels.
    &lt;Lai Sun Garment Co ltd&gt; yesterday said it acquired a 10
pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs.
    Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun
on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake.
    ""It is purely coincidence,"" he said.
    But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo
group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team
up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover.
    Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which
analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael
Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels.
    Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to
the Hk Hotels board.
    A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has
not considered any countermoves so far.
    Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the
Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management
styles.
    ""Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and
property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not
fit the conservative Kadoorie family,"" said an analyst who asked
not to be named.
    Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been
distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is
only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai
Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the
current trading price.
    Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo,
China Entertainment and the group's associate &lt;Chinese Estates
Ltd&gt;.
    Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday,
China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74
cents. Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70.50 dlrs.

Co, a concern that survived a recent hostile takeover bid,
charged that ""terrorists in three-piece suits"" are undermining

Goodyear Chairman Robert Mercer lashed out at corporate raiders
and takeover specialists, accusing them of causing serious harm
to the companies they target.
  ""Their interest is not in preserving and strengthening
America's industrial and providing jobs,"" he said. ""Their
product is simply deals, and that is not a product which a
country ... can base a future on.""
    Last year, Mercer fought off a takeover attempt by British
industrialist Sir James Goldsmith.
    But Goodyear's independence was preserved at a high price,
Mercer said.
    The company bought back Goldsmith's stock for 620 mln dlrs,
giving him a 93 mln dlr profit. Goodyear also paid him 37 mln
dlrs for expenses and bought about 41 mln other shares for over
two billion dlrs.

Outboard Marine Corp was rising on a rumor over a cable
television program that Outboard is a likely takeover target of
Sun Chemical Corp &lt;SNL&gt;.
    Outboard was up 3-1/8 to 34-5/8. On Tuesday it rose 1-3/8
to 31-1/2 Tuesday.
    A report on Cable News Network today said Sun Chemical has
4.9 pct of Outboard and is conducting a study on whether to go
for control of the whole company.
    An Outboard Marine spokesman would not comment on the
rumor.
    The cable program said a buyout of Outboard would be for up
to 40 dlrs a share, or for a total of 680 mln dlrs.
    A spokesman for Sun Chemical was not immediately available.
    Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights plan
that will be triggered when a person or group acquires
beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or begins
a tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership.
    Wayne Jones, vice president at Outboard for strategic
planning, said management wants to stay independent. ""We are
not trying to sell the company. We are proceeding with our
strategic plans,"" he said.
    That plan includes integrating five boat companies that
Outboard Marine has bought since the middle of December. Jones
said all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs.
    An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a
""decent"" price for outboard. ""A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs a
share is stretching it. Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops,"" he said.
    Outboard, which has 17 mln shares outstanding, is in
registration for a two mln common share offering with Morgan
Stanley Inc. It makes sense, the analyst said, for Sun Chemical
to strike before the offering is underway.

Amusements, Inc, predicted he can win regulatory approvals to
wrap up the 3.4 billion dlr acquisition of Viacom International
Inc in 60 to 90 days.
    Redstone, 63, catapulted himself into the big leagues of
entertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and
their financial backers decided not to top National's bid.
    ""We've had counsel working for some time in every region
where Viacom has cable televison systems"" Redstone told Reuters
in a telephone interview.
    Redstone also said ""Viacom is committed to working very
closely with us to obtain approvals."" Viacom has been seeking
approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable
systems since September when its management group first
advanced a buyout plan.
    But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding
contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that
Viacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into
a defintive merger agreement with National.
    National is a family business which operates a chain of
movie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom.
    Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through
the night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading
electronic media company. He noted that the number of motion
picture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years.
    Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom,
four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said
exclusive contracts with pay television networks are the
emerging trend. ""Up until recently you could see any motion
picture on any pay channel,"" Redstone said.
    He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios
and plans to sign a deal with a third company next month.
    Redstone said the management group's investment bankers
will be paid what is due for termination of its merger
agreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs. ""That will
be a company expense,"" Redstone said.
    He said BankAmerica &lt;BAC&gt; Corp has had numerous inquiries
from lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlr
financing for the deal. BankAmerica will provide 592 mln dlrs.
    After the merger, Viacom will be a subsidiary of National
but 17 pct of the company will be in public hands.

<title>TWA &lt;TWA&gt; TANGLES PIEDMONT &lt;PIE&gt; SITUATION</title>
<author>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    New York, March 4 - </dateline>Trans World Airlines Inc complicated
the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy
Piedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge with
Piedmont and USAir.
    Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Street
speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk
Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly
after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.
    TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It
also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and
threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer
for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.
    TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for
USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said
it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the
airlines.
    Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman
Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into
the takeover arena.
    ""We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA
into play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to
move onto somthing else,"" said one arbitrager. ""We think TWA
might just be putting up a trial balloon.""
    Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,
but that the airline will probably reject it because the price
is relatively low compared to other airline deals.
    They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by
revealing financing arrangements. ""They need to show their
commitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a
credible offer,"" said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.
    ""I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values
of airline deals,"" said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would
be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.
    USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A
spokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not
changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of
that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance
for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.
    USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln
shares.
    Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also
remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding
65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.
    Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with
its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont
and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover
of Piedmont.
    Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to
make his own airline a more attractive takeover target.
    ""Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there
were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for
making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish
that specific objective is to go out and acquire other
airlines,"" said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.
    ""I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this
way it becomes a much more viable package,"" said Kim.
    But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction
remains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load.
    Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do
the offer.
    The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial
advisers and plans to make his own arrangements.
   Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp &lt;X&gt;
and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock.
    Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was
impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal.
    Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA
offer on price and financing concerns. ""It's littered with
contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing
arrangement,"" said one executive at another major airline.
    But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a
strong contender with USAir's east coast route system and
planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the
intenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in
its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,
to the mix would develop an even stronger force.
    The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation
system.
    Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would
result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.

    Under the plan, which was presented to institutional
lenders, the company's unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp, ""substantial amounts"" of institutional debt would be
converted to common stock of the restructured company.
    Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred
stock for common. The exchange of the institutional debt and
preferred stock for common equity will cause a ""resulting
dilution of the existing common stock,"" Allis-Chalmers said in
a statement.
    Under the plan, holders of existing common would hold about
15 pct of the restructured common stock. Holders of existing
preferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common.
    Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is
bankruptcy. The restructuring must be approved by creditors,
common and preferred holders,and present and former employees.
    Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing ""appears to
represent the company's only alternative if agreement upon the
terms of the plan cannot be reached.""
    The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was
not aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that
would result from the restructuring.
    ""It is too early to talk about a charge"" because the plan
must still be approved by the lenders and unions, he said.
    Also under the plan, payments to Allis-Chalmers' private
lenders would be deferred. Trade payables and obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business will be met.
    Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees
would be made ""at substantially reduced levels.""
    Allis-Chalmers, once one of the leading farm equipment
companies, sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz
of West Germany for 107 mln dlrs, leaving the company with
businesses in lift trucks, air conditioning, fluids handling
and solid materials processing.
    Last year, Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business to
AC Material Handling Co of Columbus, Ohio.
    Under the restructuring plan, Allis-Chalmers will sell its
solid materials processing and fluids handling businesses.
Solid materials processing, which makes equipment to crush
stones for highway construction, accounted for 288 mln dlrs of
Allis-Chalmers's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs.
    The company will also sell its fluids handling operations,
which makes pumps and valves. That business accounted for 196
mln dlrs of the company's 1985 revenues.
    Allis-Chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs,
or 1.09 dlrs a share. In 1985, the company lost 168.4 mln dlrs,
or 12.27 dlrs a share.
    The company's last profit was in 1980, when it earned 52.4
mln dlrs on sales of 2.1 billion dlrs.

<title>HUGHES TOOL DIRECTORS REJECT MERGER WITH BAKER</title>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, Texas, March 5 - </dateline>The directors of Hughes Tool Co
&lt;HT&gt; said they would recommend to shareholders that they reject
a merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO&gt; today.
    Hughes vice-president Ike Kerridge said the recommendation
would be put to shareholders at a meeting scheduled for 10 A.M.
Local time (1600 GMT) to discuss the proposed merger.
    Kerridge said the board met yesterday to discuss the merger
but decided against it.
    The Hughes board objected to a U.S. Department of Justice
requirement that Baker sell off several specialised
subsidiaries in businesses related to oil-drilling.
    The Hughes board last week indicated that it might cancel
the merger because of the Department of Justice requirement.
    The board of directors of the California-based Baker had
approved the merger. On February 17 Baker said it had signed an
agreement to sell one of the subsidiaries.
    The companies had been given until April 22 to comply with
the Justice Department requirement, Kerridge said.

<title>BAKER &lt;BKO&gt; SUES TO FORCE HUGHES &lt;HT&gt; MERGER</title>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, March 5 - </dateline>Baker International corp said it has
filed suit in state court in Houston to compel Hughes Tool Co
to complete its proposed merger with Baker.
    Late yesterday, Hughes said it had terminated the merger
agreement because Baker would not agree to an alternative
divestiture plan devised by Hughes.  Hughes' board had
previously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consent
decree that would have required broader divestitures.
    Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation
from Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the Justice
Department consent decree.
    Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which
shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the
counting of votes on the deal.  Baker said it believes the vote
was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger.
    Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the
merger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were ""more
burdensome"" than those of the consent decree themselves.
    Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would
reduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs
or three pct.
    Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of
the units named in the consent decree.
    It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of
its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes to
live up to the merger agreement or ""substantial"" monetary
damages it did not name.
    Baker said it believes the merger to be in the best
interests of shareholders of both companies.

<title>USAIR &lt;U&gt; REJECTS TWA &lt;TWA&gt; TAKEOVER BID</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </dateline>USAir Group Inc said its board has
rejected Trans World Airlines Inc's offer to acquire USAir for
52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in the
best interests of USAir shareholders, employees or passengers.
    The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C.
Icahn-led TWA was ""highly conditional.""
    USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc
&lt;PIE&gt; met separately yesterday to consider USAir's offer to
acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and
remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each, valued at
about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of
USAir common during a period just before the merger.
    The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on
arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies
hope to reach one very shortly.
    USAir said ""In light of the highly conditional nature and
other terms of the TWA offer, the timing of the offer and the
circumstances under which it was made, USAir Group believes
that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir
Group's proposed acquisition of Piedmont.
    ""TWA's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl
Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group's acquisition
of Piedmont, a transaction which the USAir Group board views as
most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders, employees and
passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to
his own personal interests.""
    USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all
appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA's
last-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group's acquisition
of Piedmont.
    The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWA
obtaining financing, the USAir board redeeming defensive rights
issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the ""fair
price"" provision contained in USAir's charter inapplicable to
the TWA offer and Transportation Department approval.

insider trading, but the chairman of a House subcommittee with
jurisdiction over securities laws said he was concerned about
conditions on Wall Street.
    ""Greed has created a feeding frenzy on Wall Street and in
the process laws are broken and multi-billion dlr corporations
have become easy prey,"" Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass, the
chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance said at the
start of a hearing on SEC activities.
    ""Congress is understandably nervous. We perceive the
current scandals as a warning of even worse things to come,""
Markey said. ""The frenzy and disruption created by merger mania
is particularly distressing.""
    Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky, Dennis
Levine and others was a warning that those who engage in
insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment, high
fines and disbarment from the securities industry.
    ""Insider trading has not been eradicated, but it has been
inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky
and others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing
through to legitimate investors and traders,"" Shad said in his
statement.
    Shad said insider trading cases involved only 10 pct or
less of SEC enforcement actions in recent years but they have
increased significantly to 125 cases brought during the past
five years compared to 77 cases in the preceeding 47 years.
    Markey said he did not favor banning takeovers but thought
the tender offer process needed reform including earlier
disclosure of takeover attempts.

Republican, said he was introducing legislation to create a
five member commission to study the securities industry for a

<title>HUGHES TOOL &lt;HT&gt; SAYS BAKER &lt;BKO&gt; MERGER ALIVE</title>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, March 5 - </dateline>Hughes Tool Co Chairman W.A. Kistler
said its counter proposal to merge with Baker International
Corp was still under consideration and that a merger was in the
best interests of both companies.
    ""Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that is
good for both companies,"" Kistler said of the proposed merger
that would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field service
company. ""We're working very hard on this merger.""
    Hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting
to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11
to give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal.
    The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concern
about a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would
require Baker to sell its drilling bit operations and
submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to
terminate the proposed merger.
    The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two
companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses
before signing the decree.
    The directors of Baker immediately after receiving the
counter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state
court to force to Hughes to complete the merger.
    ""The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might
be imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous
about what the outcome might be,"" Kistler said, in explaining
why Hughes had made the counter proposal.
    ""We need additional time to understand why Baker did not
accept our proposal.""
    Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker ""was not
a factor"" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal
on the table.
    He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit.
    Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider a
compromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific.
    The Justice Department in January said it would block the
Hughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both
companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide
for the sale of the assets after the merger took place.
    The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree because
its was too ""unreasonable."" Hughes said that Baker should
instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the
merger is finalized and given government approval.
    Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptable
buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is
approved, a federal trustee would become responsible for
finding a buyer.
    Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take
up to 10 years to complete the sales.
    He also expressed concern that the combined companies might
be required by the government's conditions to license some of
its technology to any purchaser of the assets.
    Baker said last night in a statement that the required
assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs,
representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined
companies.

<title>FRANCE TO SELL STAKE IN SOCIETE GENERALE UNIT</title>
<dateline>    STRASBOURG, France, March 5 - </dateline>The French government is to
sell to the public its 47.42 pct direct holding in Societe
Generale &lt;STGN.PA&gt;'s regional bank subsidiary &lt;Societe Generale
Alsacienne de Banque&gt;, SOGENAL, from next Monday, SOGENAL
officials said.
    SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is the
leading French regional bank and has branches in Austria,
Belgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland.
    Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the share
offer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by Finance
Minister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs.
    Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised later
this year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the
bank, Chairman Marc Vienot said.
    SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated
group profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160
mln this year and 159 mln in 1985.
    SOGENAL's privatisation will be preceded by a capital
increase to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mln
francs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight,
giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal.
    The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, in
line with the Finance Ministry and government's aim of a
regional operation, Geronimus said.
    He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around
30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Ten
pct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees
with the rest offered to the public. There will not be a share
reserved for foreign investors. ""This is too small an operation
and anyway they will be able to buy shares in France,"" he said.
    Stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of
120 francs would value SOGENAL at 1.5 billion francs.
    Geronimus said the bank's future aim would be to reinforce
its existing strong points, with no major projects planned
apart from the opening soon of a Basle branch.
    SOGENAL is the only French bank in Austria, it set up the
first foreign exchange dealing room outside Paris at its
Strasbourg headquarters in 1985, and is the only foreign
banking subsidiary to be a broker on the Zurich Bourse.
    The government's banking adviser for the operation was
&lt;Banque Privee de Gestion Financiere&gt;, BPGF, owned by French
financier Pierre Moussa's &lt;Pallas&gt; group, assisted by Britain's
&lt;Hambros Bank Ltd&gt;.

<title>TALKING POINT/PIEDMONT &lt;PIE&gt;</title>
<author>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </dateline>Carl Icahn's bold takeover bid for
USAir Group &lt;U&gt; has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc,
which was being courted by USAir.
    Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc &lt;TWA&gt; made a 1.4
billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir
takeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to
accepting the bid.
    Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and
said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its
takeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.
    Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was
off 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread
it would be taken over.
    Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt
to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a
suitor who might want both airlines once they merged.
   ""The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or
Piedmont and USAir announce a deal,"" speculated one arbitrager.
    Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current
price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will
succeed.
    Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk
Southern Corp &lt;NSC&gt; has offered 65 dlrs per share for the
company. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of
Piedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.
    Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of
Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is
destined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the
least likely to be bought.
    Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in
the airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a
three-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.
    But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's
offer, which lacked financing and was riddled with
contingencies.
    Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two
airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.
    ""You can't discount him,"" said one arbitrager.
    Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is
serious by following through with his threats or making a new
offer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go
directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower
price if USAir rejected his offer.
    ""It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing,"" said
one arbitrager.
    Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by
about six dlrs per share.
    Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline
combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but
others believe it could be cleared if the companies are
acquired separately.
    ""TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to
work,"" said one analyst.
    Analysts said such a merger would be costly and
complicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn
succeeded in winning concessions from its unions.
    In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage
scale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,
analysts said.
    Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they
said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines'
costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a
necessary ingredient for a merger to work.
    However, other analysts speculated the managements of
Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new
company. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way
for him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged
into TWA.

    The proposed merger that would create a 1.2 billion dlr

    Earlier today, Hughes adjourned a shareholders meeting

it hoped to resume negotitations with Baker.

<title>HUGHES &lt;HT&gt; CHANGES STANCE ON MERGER AFTER SUIT</title>
<author>    by Cal Mankowski, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </dateline>A one billion dlr lawsuit pushed
Hughes Tool Co into an about-face on its rejection of a
proposed merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO&gt;, Wall
Street analysts said.
    Last night, Hughes said the planned merger with Baker was
off. Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from
Hughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes said
it was still interested in the merger.
    The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its
troubles could make it a takeover candidate.
    There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallas
investor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reuters
he is not interested.
    Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securities
and Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in
some publicly traded company. He declined to identify the
target other than to rule out Hughes.
    One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes
turnabout was Borg-Warner Corp &lt;BOR&gt;, which owns 18.5 pct of
Hughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F. Bere, who serves on the
Hughes board, is believed to favor the merger with Baker.
    Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in a
merger, and Baker's response that a merger is still possibile,
analysts said no one could be certain where the situation was
going.
    ""I think the merger is not going through,"" said Phil Pace,
analyst at Kidder, Peabody and Co. He said the merger ""lost a
lot of its appeal"" when the U.S. Department of Justice required
that Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation.
    Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of
the total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said ""30 to 40
pct of the cost savings are tied up in that.""
    ""They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,""
said James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.
""Apparently they are willing to continue discussions but
whether they will alter their position, I don't know.
    ""It's getting a little confusing,"" said James Carroll,
analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments cited
by Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger ""tend to be weak.""
Hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it
wanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22,
the projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longer
period of time.
    Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the
companies with the status of Reed already settled. Baker
apparently sees no reason to speed up the sale.
    Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln

<title>PESCH UNIT SEEKS BALANCE OF REPUBLIC HEALTH</title>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, March 5 - </dateline>Alpha Health Systems Corp, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Pesch and Co, said it submitted a
merger proposal to the board of REPH Acquisition Co, the parent
company of Republic Health Corp, which is 64 pct owned by Pesch

    The balance of REPH's common stock is owned by members of
Republic management, McDonnell Douglas Corp &lt;MD&gt;, Donaldson,
Lufkin and Jenrette and Pacific Asset Holdings L.P.
    Republic currently owns 44 hospitals and manages 46 other

    Details of the proposal were not disclosed.  Company
representatives were not immediately available.
    The proposal provides that REPH would become a wholly-owned

stockholders would become stockholders of Alpha, it said.
    REPH's board has appointed a special committee to negotiate
terms of the proposed merger, Pesch said.
    Last year, Republic was acquired by REPH in a leveraged
buyout transaction led by Dr. LeRoy Pesch, the principal
shareholder of Pesch and Co.

<title>CHEMLAWN &lt;CHEM&gt; REJECTS WASTE'S &lt;WMX&gt; OFFER</title>
<dateline>    COLUMBUS, Ohio, March 5 -  </dateline>ChemLawn Corp said its board
rejected Waste Management Inc's 27 dlr-per-share tender offer
and urged its shareholders not to tender their shares.
    ChemLawn said its board asked management and its financial
advisor, Smith Barney, Harris Upham And Co Inc, to seek other
purchasers of the company to maximize shareholder value.
    ChemLawn also said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, or
""poison pill,"" during a 120-intermin safeguard period its board
adopted to deter attempts to acquire the company through any
means other than an all-cash tender offer while it seeks other
purchasers.
    ChemLawn also said it began litigation against Waste
Management in federal court in Columbus, seeking injunctive and
other relief.
    The suit alleges, among other things, that certain Waste
Management officers and directors purchased ChemLawn's stock
before making the tender offer. ChemLawn claimed such purchases
possibly violated the officers' fiduciary duties and the
Securities and Exchange Commission's insider trading rules.
    Last week, Waste Management made a tender offer to acquire
ChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs.
    ChemLawn said its board was determined that Waste's offer
was inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders,
and could ""adversely affect"" the interests of its employees,
suppliers, creditors, and customers.
    ""Our board carefully reviewed Waste Management offer and
concluded that it does not fully reflect the value of the
company. We strongly urge our shareholders not to tender their
shares to Waste Management,"" said Chairman L. Jack Van Fossen.
    ChemLawn said its rights plan is designed to protect
shareholders against abusive tactics, such as ""market
accumulations by Waste Management or others.""
    Under the plan, one comon stock purchase right will be
distributed as a dividend on each outstanding share of ChemLawn
common.
    ChemLawn said its rights holders can buy a share of its
common for one dlr if any entity acquires 25 pct or more of its
commmon, other than by an all cash tender offer for all its
shares or an approved acquisition agreement by its board.
    It said the rights expire July three 1987, or 60 days after
they become exercisable if later than that date. It said its
board may redeem the rights for five cts per right any time
prior to their exercise date.
    ChemLawn said the plan will not be triggered by purchases
purusant to Waste Management's present tender offer.
    It said the dividend will be paid to shareholders of record
March 20.

the Hunt family of Dallas, Texas, told the Securities and
Exchange Commission it has acquired a 6.2 pct stake in Comdata
Network Inc &lt;CDN&gt; and may try to influence company policy.
    The investor group, led by Rosewood Financial Inc, said it
opposes a company recapitalization plan worked out between
Comdata and Mason Best Co, a Texas investment firm, which last
reported holding about 9.5 pct of the company's stock.
    The Hunt group said it offered on March 3 to buy the entire
5.3 pct stake held by dissident shareholder Donald Carter at 14
dlrs each, but has received no reply as of yesterday.
    Rosewood, which is owned by the Caroline Hunt Trust Estate,
whose trustees include Margaret Hunt Hill, also said it has

    Under federal law, it cannot buy more than 15 pct of
Comdata's stock until a 15 to 30 day waiting period is over,
unless the FTC gives it early approval.
    Under the proposed Comdata recapitalization plan, the
company would buy up to 10 mln of its common shares at 13.25

    Mason Best, which belongs to CNI Parnters, a Texas
partnership, would not tender any of its stake under the plan,
but would instead buy another one mln Comdata common shares and
would get representation on the company's board.
    The Hunt group said it has told Comdata that it considers
required payments under the plan, such as a 1.5 mln dlr fee and
the issuance of a warrant to buy 500,000 common shares to be a
waste of the company's assets.

<title>NORDBANKEN TO AUCTION ITS FERMENTA SHARES</title>
<dateline>    STOCKHOLM, March 6 - </dateline>Sweden's &lt;Nordbanken&gt; banking group
said it would sell the 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loan
collateral by Fermenta AB's &lt;FRMS.ST&gt; founder and former chief
executive Refaat el-Sayed and it planned to buy them up itself.
    The bank said the sale - by public auction on March 16 --
was because of a debtor's inability to repay an overdue loan.
    The B free shares closed at 16.50 crowns on the bourse's
unofficial list -- down from a peak of 300 in January 1986.
Nordbanken said it did not exclude accepting a suitable bid for
the shares although it expected to buy them back itself.
    The statement said the sale did not represent any
withdrawal from Nordbanken's undertakings towards the Fermenta
group and that it had been sanctioned by the other main
shareholders.
    Nordbanken is Fermenta's third largest creditor with loans
of 155 mln crowns. It was one of the four Swedish banks which
last month agreed to advance the group 110 mln crowns to solve
its immediate liquidity problems. Together with two other main
shareholders, it also advanced Fermenta an additional 65 mln
crowns until a new equity issue could be made.
    Fermenta is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders'
meeting on Tuesday to approve the planned equity issue.
    Nordbanken had to make a provision against a 200 mln crown
loan to el-Sayed in its 1986 results.
    Fermenta's new management originally hoped to raise 160 mln
crowns through the new one for four rights issue and an extra
170 mln from an issue to Nordbanken, another major creditor and
shareholder &lt;Gotabanken&gt; and the group's new majority owner
&lt;Industrivarden AB&gt;.
    The share price was to be 20 crowns. But there has been
doubt over the plans since the stock fell below this level this
week after Fermenta's former chairman Kjell Brandstrom said the
company was in a much worse state than he thought.

    Telecom said it advised Siemens it intends to close the
transaction on March 16, as scheduled, if it is approved by
shareholders. A spokesman said this means Telecom will decide
before the 16th whether or not to accept the proposed change.
    Explaining its request for the amendment, Siemens informed
Telecom it had recently become aware of information causing
concern with respect to certain accounting and other matters.
    Siemens said it will therefore need to continue its review
beyond March 16 to determine whether certain representations
and warranties are true.

<title>LUCKY STORES &lt;LKS&gt;, EDELMAN IN STANDSTILL PACT</title>
<dateline>    DUBLIN, Calif., March 6 - </dateline>Lucky Stores Inc said it and
investor Asher Edelman agreed on a settlement that prohibits
Edelman and his group from taking specified actions to obtain
control of the company and that limits the Edelman group's
ownership of Lucky's stock to less than five pct of any voting
securities.
    The arrangement also provides for the dismissal of pending
litigation between the parties, Lucky Stores said.
    The settlement also calls for the withdrawal of Edelman's
motion to intervene in pending shareholder actions against
Lucky Stores and its directors, the company said.
    In addition, the standstill provisions also apply to
Hancock Fabrics after it is spun off to Lucky stockholders, the
company said.
    Lucky Stores said the arrangement also calls for the
company to submit to stockholders at a special meeting set for
December 31 a proposal from Edelman seeking their views
concerning repeal of a charter provision that limits the voting
power of substantial Lucky stockholders.
    Edelman, who owns about five pct of Lucky Stores' stock,
last year was rebuffed in his effort to acquire the company.
    Last October Lucky Stores implimented a restructuring
program that included the repurchase of 28 pct of its own
common shares and reincorporation in Delaware.
    The spinoff of Hancock Textile Co, a chain of 324 retail
stores, was one of the key parts of the restructuring program.
    Edelman and his Plaza Securities Co partnership
subsequently sued in an attempt to block the proposed
reincorporation, which was a condition of the repurchase and
restructuring plan.
    Under this latest arrangement, Lucky Stores said it agreed
to reimburse the Edelman group for 2.8 mln dlrs of
out-of-pocket expenses, which include litigation and other
costs.

<title>GROUP TO BOOST FAIRCHILD INDUSTRIES (FEN) STAKE</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </dateline>An investor group led by New York
investor George Soros said it was dissatisfied with Fairchild
Industries Inc management and was considering boosting its
holdings to as much as 49.9 pct of the aerospace and aviation
company's outstanding stock.
    The group already controls 1,647,481 Fairchild Industries
shares or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding.
    The group said it filed on Wednesday with federal antitrust
regulators for advance clearance to buy enough additional
shares to increase its total stake to up to 49.9 pct of the
total outstanding stock.
    The group said its representatives had met with Fairchild
Industries officials to inform them ""that they do not believe
management has been successful in enhancing or protecting
shareholder values.""
    It said it was considering the additional share purchases
to enable it to ""assert a greater degree of influence over the
future management and policies of the issuer.""
    It said a decision on the specific level of share ownership
it would seek depended on market prices, future changes in
management policies, available financial resources and other
factors.
    The group said it also reserved the right to pursue other
measures intended to influence Fairchild management and
policies, either alone or in concert with other investors.
    The group includes Soros and Quantum Fund, an offshore
investment firm headquartered in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles
that is advised by Soros.
    The group said that since its last SEC filing, made Jan. 2,
it had purchased no additional Fairchild shares and had sold
6,700 shares on the New York Stock Exchange Jan. 19.
    A Fairchild Industries official later said Soros had told

today that he is not dissatisfied with management,"" Fairchild's
Bill Fulwider told Reuters.

<title>DOME PETE&lt;DMP&gt; SAID TO BE PRESSED TO SELL ENCOR</title>
<author>    By Larry Welsh, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TORONTO, March 6 - </dateline>Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressure
from one of its largest creditors, &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce&gt;, to sell its 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Ltd&gt;,
energy industry analysts said.
    Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for
part of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947
mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to
pay down debt, analysts said.
    ""The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the
direction that might make it a saleable asset,"" said one analyst
who asked not to be named.
    Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor
Energy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in
Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd &lt;DM&gt; is up for sale ""at
the right price.""
    Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10
billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that
it does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. The
Encor shares do not pay dividends.
    A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked
whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.
    At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would be
valued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines
shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.
    Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also
prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the
Canadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.
    ""Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in
recent weeks with a runup in crude prices,"" Peters and Co Ltd
oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.
    ""The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it
sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than
they have been able to in recent years,"" he added.
    Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at
7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six
dlrs in early February.
    The company also recently set up its own operating
management, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,
Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.
    Dome and Encor ""are actually going to get farther apart. So
(the sale) does make a lot of sense,"" Mote said.
    However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest
Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale
proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to
Commerce Bank.
    ""I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as
they can,"" said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.
    Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to
block such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.
    ""Other creditors generally all want to make sure that
something they might be able to get a piece of is not being
sold out from under them,"" said analyst Gobert.
    Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint
liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic
Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.
    Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the
possible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.
    Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's
debt and has a ""right of consent"" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's
holding.
    Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares
would seek some type of relief on the company's debt
obligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.
    Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what
price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,
but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share ""are very
attractive.""

<title>USAIR &lt;U&gt; SEEKS ORDER AGAINST TWA &lt;TWA&gt;</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </dateline>USAir Group said it sought the help
of the U.S. Department of Transportation in its takeover fight
with Trans World Airlines Inc, asking the Department to order
TWA to sell its USAir shares.
    ""What they have done is in direct violation of the Federal
Aviation Act,"" USAir said.
    It said TWA week filed a cursory application with the
Department of Transportation for approval of its proposed 1.65
billion dlr takeover of USAir.
    USAir rejected the offer and said it asked the Department
of Transportation to dismiss the application.
    USAir said it requested the dismissal because TWA avoided
pre-merger notification requirements, and also did not provide
a competitive and public interest analysis required under
regulations.
    USAir said if the application is dismissed, TWA would be
limited to buying only 1.5 pct of its 31.7 mln outstanding
shares. If the application is approved, TWA could buy up to 10
pct, it said. TWA has said it owns less than 10 pct of USAir's
stock.
    TWA today revealed that it has increased its holdings to
more than four mln USAir shares, 15 pct of the outstanding.
    TWA vice president general counsel Mark Buckstein said the
company had made appropriate filings with the DOT and was in
compliance with the law.

<title>TAFT&lt;TFB&gt; BIDDERS WOULD SELL ENTERTAINMENT UNIT</title>
<author>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </dateline>A proposed buyout of Taft Broadcasting
Co by Dudley Taft and other investors includes a plan to sell
the company's Entertainment Group, according to one of the
investors.
    Jonathan Nelson, managing director of Narragansett Capital
Corp &lt;NARR&gt;, which is participating in the buyout plan,
declined to say if buyers have already been lined up for the
Entertainment Group. ""We are considering selling the group,""
Nelson said. Wall Street analysts said any of the Hollywood
film studios which might be interested.
    Taft Broadcasting Co did not comment on the 145 dlr per
share offer. Taft has 9.2 mln shares outstanding, of which 12
pct are owned by the Taft and Ingalls families.
    Dudley Taft relinquished the title of president in July but
continues as vice chairman of the company.
    Taft-Narragansett requsted a response to its proposal by
March 12.
    If the plan is accepted, Taft would be a private company
financed by high yield bonds and bank debt, Nelson said.
Narragansett is an investment management company specializing
in leveraged buyout transactions.
    Taft shares climbed 19 to 151-1/2, causing arbitrageurs to
say investors believe the bidders may raise their price.
    Robert M. Bass, who controls 25 pct of the stock, and
American Financial Corp, holder of 15 pct, did not return
telephohe calls seeking comment.
    But Dennis McAlpine, analyst at Oppenheimer and Co, said ""I
don't think it's worth 150 dlrs."" He noted Taft recently agreed
to sell a group of independent television stations at a loss.
He said the entertainment group, which includes the
Hanna-Barbara animation studios, is currently hampered by a
glut of animated product.
    Taft Broadcasting has never commented on reports that its
major stockholders met recently to discuss a break-up of the
company.
    MacAlpine said there are lots of options for reshaping the
company with a distribution of various pieces to the major
shareholders among the possibilities.
    Analyst Alan Gottesman of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg Towbin
Inc said the Bass group has been increasing its stake in the
belief the company would be worth more with a change in its
strategy. He said Bass pushed for sale of the independent
television stations because the company paid too much.

<title>DOT DISMISSES TWA &lt;TWA&gt;, USAIR &lt;U&gt; APPLICATION</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </dateline>The U.S. Department of Transportation
(DOT) said it dismissed on technical grounds an application by
Trans World Airlines Inc for DOT approval for it to take
control of USAir Group.
    The DOT added, however, that TWA was free to refile when it
could put together an application for control that met the
agency's procedural requirements.
    The DOT acted shortly after the U.S. Department of Justice
disclosed that it supported dismissal of the TWA application.
    It was not immediately clear what impact the denial would
have on TWA's bid to take over USAir.
    In its control application, TWA had acknowledged that
additional documentation was required to meet DOT rules and
said it would file more material on the morning of March 9.
    But the DOT said it would not wait.
    ""We have determined to dismiss TWA's application for
approval of the acquisition of USAir,"" it said in an order
issued late Friday.
    ""TWA's application clearly fails to comply with the filing
requirements of our regulations...and TWA has provided no
reason why we should accept such a deficient filing,"" it added.
    ""Accordingly, we will dismiss the application. TWA, of
course, may refile it when it is able to comply with our
procedural rules,"" the DOT said.
    The agency added that it would continue to consider a
separate TWA request for federal clearance to purchase USAir
stock through a voting trust.
    USAir had said earlier today that it asked the DOT to
dismiss the TWA control application, on grounds the TWA filing
did not meet DOT requirements.

<title>MALAYSIA BAILS OUT ANOTHER COMMERCIAL BANK</title>
<dateline>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 7 - </dateline>Malaysia's central bank said it
acquired a 59.2 pct stake in ailing &lt;United Asian Bank Bhd&gt;
(UAB), the sixth largest commercial bank in the country, to
rebuild public confidence in it.
    UAB called for a rights issue last November to raise 152.49
mln ringgit to rectify its capital deficiency following an
accumulated loss of 107.61 mln ringgit at end-1985, the central
bank, Bank Negara, said in a statement.
    But only 16.99 mln ringgit in shares was taken up by
shareholders, mainly local Indian and Malay businessmen and the
Indian Government.
    Bank Negara said it subsequently took up the unsubscribed
shares, totalling 135.5 mln of UAB's new paid-up capital of
228.74 mln ringgit.
    It said the shares, held in trust, will be eventually sold.
    The central bank early this week also announced that it had
bought 49.4 pct stake in another troubled commercial bank,
&lt;Perwira Habib Bank Malaysia Bhd&gt;, after the latter raised its
capital to 405 mln ringgit from 105 in mid-January this year.
    Bank Negara said it does not intend to hold on to the
shares of the two banks.
    ""The injection of capital in PHB and in UAB including the
recamp of management in these banks are some of the measures
taken by the bank to strengthen public confidence in the
stability of the these banks,"" it added.
    The central bank said it is invoking Section 39A of the
Banking (Amendemnt) Act 1986 empowering it to grant loans to an
ailing bank or to buy a stake in it.

<title>PIEDMONT &lt;PIE&gt; AGREES TO USAIR &lt;U&gt; BUYOUT</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 9 - </dateline>USAir Group Inc said Piedmont Aviation
Inc has agreed to be acquired for 69 dlrs per share.
    The company, in a newspaper advertisement, said it has
started a tender offer for all Piedmont shares at that price,
and the Piedmont board, with two directors absent, has
unanimously approved the bid.  The offer and withdrawal rights
are to expire April Three unless extended, and the bid is to be
followed by a merger at the same price.
    USAir said Piedmont has granted it an irrevocable option to
buy up to 3,491,030 new shares under certain circumstances.
Piedmont now has about 18.6 mln shares outstanding.
    USAir said the tender is conditioned on receipt of enough
shares to give USAir at least a 50.1 pct interest in Piedmont
on a fully diluted basis and approval by the U.S. Department of
Transportation of a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to
buy and hold shares pending review of its application to gain
control of Piedmont.
    The company said its merger agreement with Piedmont
provides that the offer is not to be amended without Piedmont's
prior written consent in any way that would be adverse to
Piedmont shareholders, but it said it could cut the number of
shares to be bought without Piedmont's consent.
    USAir said it could reduce the number of Piedmont shares to
be purchased in the offer to no less than the minimum number
needed to cause the voting trust condition of the bid to be
satisfied.
    In that case, it said if more than that minimum number of
shares were tendered, it would buy shares on a pro rata basis.
    In February USAir had offered to pay 71 dlrs per share in
cash for 50 pct of Piedmont's stock and 1.55 to 1.90 USAir
shares for each remaining Piedmont share.
    Last week, Carl C. Icahn-controlled Trans World Airlines
Inc &lt;TWA&gt; made a conditional offer to acquire USAir for 52 dlrs
per share, a bid that was rejected by the USAir board.
    The Transportation Department on Friday rejected TWA's
application to acquire USAir on the grounds that the
application failed to comply with department regulations by
omitting necessary information.  TWA said it would refile
today, providing the information needed.
    On Friday TWA said it had already acquired four mln shares
or 15 pct of USAir.

<title>SOSNOFF STARTS BID FOR CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW&gt;</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 9 - </dateline>&lt;MTS Acquisition Corp&gt;, a company
formed by Martin T. Sosnoff, said it has started a tender offer
for all shares of Caesars World Inc at 28 dlrs each.
    In a newspaper advertisement, MTS said the offer and
withdrawal rights expire April Three unless extended.
    Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns about four mln
of Caesars' 30.3 mln shares outstanding, or about 13.3 pct, and
is Caesars' largest shareholder.  Caesars owns casino hotels in
Nevada and honeymoon resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono
Mountains.  It also controls Caesars New Jersey Inc &lt;CJN&gt;,
which owns an Atlantic City, N.J., casino hotel.
    For the second quarter ended January 31, Caesars World
earned 12.6 mln dlrs on revenues of 190.4 mln dlrs, up from
earnings of 7,500,000 dlrs and revenues of 163.8 mln dlrs a
year before.  For all of fiscal 1986, the company earned 41.0
mln dlrs on revenues of 694.4 mln dlrs.
    MTS said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least
enough shares to give Sosnoff a majority interest on a fully
diluted basis, the arrangement of sufficient financing to buy
all Caesars shares not already owned and pay related costs and
approval by the New Jersey Casino control Commission and the
NEvada Gaming Commission and State Gaming Control Board.
    MTS said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM&gt; has committed to
lend it 100 mln dlrs for the acquisition and use its best
efforts to syndicate another 400 mln dlrs in senior financing
for the transaction.
    It said its financial adviser, PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ&gt;,
has stated in writing that subject to market conditions, it is
highly confident that it can arrange commitments for up to 475
mln dlrs in ""mezzanine"" financing.
    MTS said it does not expect problems in obtaining New
Jersey and Nevada regulatory approval for the acquisition,
since ownership in a Caesars stake has already been cleared.
    In June 1986, Sosnoff requested a seat on the Caesars World
board, a request that has not yet been granted.  In September
1986, Sosnoff, who is chairman of &lt;Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital
Corp&gt;, filed for clearance under U.S. antitrust laws to raise
his interest in Caesars World to 25 pct.
    Sosnoff said, in a letter to Caesars World chairman and
chief executive officer Henry Gluck, that ""The decision to go
directly to the shareholders was made at the urging of may
financial and legal advisors, who repeatedly stressed to me the
lack of responsiveness of the management in the past.""
    Sosnoff, who said he has made numerous efforts to express
his views to management on ways of maximizing shareholder
values, said Caesars twicce refused his request for a board
seat.  ""My advisers felt that, had I given you advance notice,
you would have used the time to throw up obstacles to my offer
rather than giving it serious consideration,"" he said.
    Sosnoff said he hopes that Caesars World management will be
willing to negotiate an acquisition agreement with him.
    ""As I have indicated publicly in the past, I believe
operating management of the company has performed well and that
appropriate consideration should be given to a significant
equity interest for them in the company following the
acquisition,"" Sosnoff said in the letter to Gluck.
    MTS said Sosnoff has asked the company to fix March 27 as
the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled
to authorize action without a meeting -- including the election
or removal of directors.

<title>GENCORP&lt;GY&gt; UNIT TO SELL LOS ANGELES TV STATION</title>
<dateline>    AKRON, Ohio, March 9 - </dateline>Gencorp said its RKO General
subsidiary agreed to sell KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to Walt Disney
Co &lt;DIS&gt; for 217 mln dlrs cash plus working capital and other
adjustments at closing.
    The company said under the agreement in principle, RKO's
application to renew the station's broadcast license would be
dismissed and the competing application of Fidelity Television
would be granted. Disney would then acquire privately held
Fidelity for about 103 mln dlrs and other adjustments.
    Renewal of the KHJ-TV license has been challenged in
regulatory proceedings for more than 20 years.
    The deal is subject to prior approval by the Federal
Communications Commission, the company said.
    Late in 1985, Gencorp cut a deal with Fidelity, a Los
Angeles investor group, and Westinghouse Electric Corp &lt;WX&gt; to
settle the license proceedings and sell KHJ-TV for 313 mln
dlrs, 70 pct of which would go to Westinghouse and the
remainder to Fidelity. But on Jan 28, 1987, Westinghouse
withdrew from the deal because the FCC would not approve it.
    In early 1986, Gencorp and RKO agreed to sell WOR-TV in
Secaucus, N.J., to MCA Inc &lt;MCA&gt; for 387 mln dlrs. The FCC has
approved the transaction, but several parties have appealed.
    The FCC has not said when it would rule on the appeals,
according to a spokemsan for Akron, Ohio-based Gencorp.
    Fidelity Television originally filed a competing
application for the RKO license for KHJ, an independent
station, in 1965.
    In 1980, the FCC disqualified RKO as licensee of WNAC-TV in
Boston, citing anti-competitive trade practices and inaccurate
financial reporting to the agency, causing renewals previously
granted to RKO in New York, for WOR, and Los Angeles, for KHJ,
to be denied.

    ""There's been rumors that they've taken a position in the
company, said Wood Gundie analyst Edward Comeau.
    Last year, Dart Group, owner of Auto Trak INc and Crown
Books, competed against Kohlberg, Kravis to acquire Safeway
Stores INc.
    The company later reached an accord under which it would
buy 20 pct of the company after Kohlberg Kravis completed its
leveraged buyout of the company.
    The company later sold its 20 pct stock for about 180 mln

Viner and Co, said, ""They &lt;Dart&gt; has been rumored to be buying
some other supermarkets as well, such as Stop and Shop.""
    ""My guess is that Supermarkets General does not want to be
bought out,"" said Ballan.
    Analysts, however, said Supermarkets General is facing
problems due to its Purity Supreme and Rickels operations,
which might make it difficult to thwart a bid.
    Supermarkets General is expected to report about 1.70 dlrs
a share compared to a 1.73 dlrs a share reported for 1985 on a
post stock split basis.
    For the first quarter, Comeau predicts the company will

<title>TALKING POINT/CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW&gt;</title>
<author>    By Greg Calhoun, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LOS ANGELES, March 9 - </dateline>&lt;MTS Acquisition Corp's&gt;
28-dlr-per-share offering price for Caesars World Inc is
thought to be much too low and is likely to attract other
suitors for the hotel/casino company, industry analysts said.
    ""I think someone else will probably come in, or they (MTS)
will have to raise their bid,"" said Marvin Roffman, an analyst
at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
    MTS, a company formed by Martin Sosnoff, Caesars World's
largest shareholder, today began a tender offer, valued at
725.2 mln dlrs, for all shares Sosnoff doesn't already own.
    ""I think the offer is too low by at least five points,""
said Roffman, who described Caesars World as the operator of
""one of the finest casinos in the world.""
    Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns 13.3 pct of
Caesars World's 30.3 mln shares.
    Following news of the tender offer Caesars World's shares
were trading at 27-7/8, up 3-3/8.
    A Caesars World spokesman said the company was declining
comment on the Sosnoff move for the moment, but Caesars may
issue a public statement after it has studied the offer.
    Roffman said Caesars World has considerable growth
potential and he is forecasting fiscal 1988 earnings of two
dlrs per share.
    Caesars World owns casino hotels in Nevada and honeymoon
resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. It also controls
Caesars New Jersey Inc &lt;CJN&gt;, which owns an Atlantic City,
N.J., casino hotel.
    For its fiscal year ended July 31 Caesars World reported
net income of 41 mln dlrs, or 1.36 dlrs per primary share.
    The company reported second quarter net income of 12.6 mln
dlrs, or 41 cts per share, compared with income of 7.5 mln
dlrs, or 25 cts per share a year earlier.
    Daniel Lee, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, said
that although Sosnoff's relatively low bid may attract other
suitors willing to pay a higher price for Caesars, there is
little likelihood that a competing bid would start a battle for
the company.

<title>CHRYSLER &lt;C&gt; AMC BUYOUT VALUED AT 1.55 BILLION</title>
<author>    By Richard Walker, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    DETROIT, March 9 - </dateline>Chrysler Corp's proposed acquisition of
American Motors Corp is valued at about 1.55 billion dlrs,
including the cost of acquisition and the 767 mln dlrs in
American Motor' debt that Chrysler will assume, analysts said.
    They said Chrysler's cost of acquisition was valued at  782
mln dlrs, paid in cash, notes and Chrysler shares.
    The analysts told Reuters that at a New York briefing
Chrysler treasurer Fred Zuckerman outlined his company's
agreement with Renault to assume AMC's debt as well as 332 mln
dlrs in unfunded pension liabilities, though the latter is not
included valuing the transaction.
    Analysts were generally positive on Chrysler's proposed
purchase of its much-smaller rival, but said they expected the
transaction would carry with it a short-term dilution in
Chrysler's earnings.
    A Chrysler financial source, speaking anonymously, told
Reuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than it
would have been had a deal been struck last year because the
impact of the new U.S. tax law removes Chrysler's ability to
assume AMC's large reserve of tax-loss carryforwards
accumulated from its losses since 1980.
    ""There were very serious discussions last fall but we
didn't pull it off,"" the source said in a reference to the
assassination in November of former Renault chairman Georges
Besse.
    ""It's too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor.
And Renault could have gotten a much better price if we'd done
it before the end of last year.""
    In addition to AMC's debt and its pension liabilities, the
source said Chrysler would also assume any liability from
lawsuits over the safety of Jeeps, which he called ""an overhang
to the company.""
    Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them that
the deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principal
in the form of a 10-year note at eight pct interest, 35 mln
dlrs cash for Renault's equity in AMC's finance subsidiary, 25
mln dlrs in cash for ""transaction fees"" in connection with the
acquisition and 522 mln dlrs worth of Chrysler stock to be paid
AMC shareholders.
    ""The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption,""
analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters.
     Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 12
billion dlrs of Chrysler Corp and unit debt due to the deal.
     But the Chrysler source said that in assuming AMC's
liabilities, his company will refinance at a lower rate any AMC
debt that is being carried at ""non-market"" rates.
    He said there were difficulties in negotiating with the
previous Renault management on the acquisition because they
were committed to the group's business plan of which AMC was an
integral part.
    ""The new management didn't have that problem - AMC wasn't
their baby,"" he said.

<title>LINDNER SAYS HE DISCUSSED CONTROL OF TAFT &lt;TFB&gt;</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 9 - </dateline>Financier Carl Lindner, who holds a
16.2 pct stake in Taft Broadcasting Co, told the Securities and
Exchange Commission he has discussed with the company the
possibility of seeking control of it.
    Lindner, the Cincinnati, Ohio, investor who controls
American Financial Corp, said his talks with some of Taft's
managers and directors have been aimed at ""achieving an
increased ownership position"" in the company.
    Lindner said his increase in ownership would be made either
by making an offer to acquire control of Taft or taking part in
a group to acquire the company.
    Lindner, who holds his Taft stake through American
Financial and its subsidiaries, said he is also considering
buying more Taft stock on the open market or in private deals.
    He did not say whether the talks with Taft officials led to
any agreements or understandings.
    But Lindner said he intends to review his investment in
Taft and may be involved in further talks or take other steps
regarding the future control and direction of Taft.
    Lindner's investor group recently raised its Taft stake to
1,489,298 shares, or 16.2 pct from 1,439,498 shares, or 15.6
pct, after buying 49,800 shares for a total of 5.8 mln dlrs.
    Although he recently received clearance from the Federal

Lindner in previous SEC filings has always stressed that his
interest in Taft was for investment only and not was not
seeking to control the company.

<title>CHRYSLER &lt;C&gt; DEAL LEAVES UNCERTAINTY FOR AMC WORKERS</title>
<author>    By Richard Walker, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    DETROIT, March 11 - </dateline>Chrysler Corp's 1.5 billion dlr bid to
takeover American Motors Corp &lt;AMO&gt; should help bolster the
small automaker's sales, but it leaves the future of its 19,000
employees in doubt, industry analysts say.
    It was ""business as usual"" yesterday at the American Motors
headquarters, one day after the proposed merger was unveiled by
Chrysler and AMC's French parent Renault, according to company
spokesman Edd Snyder.
    But AMC's future, to be discussed at a board meeting today,
would be radically different as a Chrysler subsidiary than if
it had continued with the state-run French car group as its
controlling shareholder.
    Industry analysts said the future of AMC's car assembly
plant in Kenosha, Wis., and its Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant would
be in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the North American
auto industry by the early 1990s comes to pass.
    Both plants are far from ""state of the art"" for car
manufacturing sites, and AMC has a history of poor labor
relations at each.
    ""Chrysler doesn't need that many new plants,"" said Michael
Luckey, automotive analyst for the Wall Street firm Shearson
Lehman Brothers. ""They probably will close the Toledo plant and
move Jeep production to Canada.""
    Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that at the
very least, the new owner of the Toledo plant would be able to
wring concessions from the United Automobile Workers union
local representing Jeep workers.
    ""The UAW won't be able to hold them up for ransom as they
have AMC because during a down year, Chrysler will have
underutilized facilities to transfer production,"" he said.
    Analysts said they foresaw no major complications that
would abort a combination which historians said would be the
auto industry's biggest merger since American Motors was formed
in 1954.
    AMC was in need of a financial savior because of its losses
of more than 800 mln dlrs since 1980 and pressures in France
for Renault to cut its backing. The company had said it could
not forecast consistent profitability until 1988 at the
earliest.
    In announcing the takeover agreement, Chrysler chairman Lee
Iacocca cited AMC's Jeep division as well as its new 675 mln
dlr assembly plant at Bramalea, Ontario, and its network of
1,200 dealers as the major attractions.
    Analysts reasoned that Chrysler might feel moved eventually
to sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overhead
costs in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incur
in the AMC buyout.

    Rule was responding to panel Chairman Howard Metzenbaum

    But Rule said that, for airline companies, a purchaser
would be exempt from the requirement if it instead had filed a

<title>BELGIAN MINISTER UNVEILS PRIVATISATION PLAN</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, March 11 - </dateline>Belgian Budget Minister Guy
Verhofstadt has proposed a plan to sell off shares in several
state-owned enterprises, including national airline Sabena and
the postal and telecommunications authority, government sources
said.
    They said the plan could raise more than 25 billion francs
in revenue over the next five years according to Verhofstadt's
projections, helping the government to reduce its huge budget
deficit, targetted this year at 418 billion francs.
    But the scheme had received a guarded reception from the
Social Christian parties in Belgium's centre-right coalition
when Verhofstadt unveiled it at a cabinet meeting yesterday.
    Discussion of the plan was likely to be long and difficult,
the sources said.
    Verhofstadt proposes beginning the selloffs in the last
quarter of 1987, with the sale of 30 to 40 pct of state
investment company SNI. He expects the sale to raise three
billion francs, they added.
    A 25 pct share in Sabena would be sold in mid-1989 for 1.5
billion francs, while 50 pct of the postal and
telecommunications authority would be sold off in two stages in
mid-1990 and early 1992, raising at least seven billion francs.
    Also on Verhofstadt's list are the Maritime Transport
Authority, leading gas distributor Distrigaz, CGER savings
bank, CGER, and several other credit institutions.
    Le Soir daily quoted CGER vice-president Paul Henrion as
expressing strong opposition to the privatisation of his bank.

<title>WALL STREET STOCKS/TENNECO INC &lt;TGT&gt;</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, MARCH 11 - </dateline>Tenneco Inc, a company that has long
been rumored to be a takeover candidate, rose sharply today
when speculation surfaced that investor T. Boone Pickens may be
targeting the company for an acquisition, traders and analysts
said.
    Tenneco spokesman Joseph Macrum said ""we have no comment to
make whatsoever."" Pickens was not available for comment.
    Traders noted that activity in the stock increased today
after a published report linked Pickens to Tenneco.
    Tenneco rose two points to 48-3/4.
    Paul Feretti, an analyst with New Orleans-based Howard,
Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, Inc, said he was not surprised at
market rumors that Tenneco might be the target of a takeover
attempt.
    ""It's pure market speculation that Boone Pickens and his
group may be interested,"" Feretti said.
    ""But Tenneco would be a challenge to run because of its
sheer size and diversity. Mr. Pickens is a man who likes a
challenge.""
    Pickens, who made an unsuccessful attempt to take over
Dallas-based Diamond Shamrock Corp &lt;DIA&gt; last winter, has made
no secret of his plans to acquire additional natural gas
reserves in the belief that gas prices will stabilize sooner
than oil prices. Tenneco holds natural gas reserves estimated
in excess of 3.5 trillion cubic feet, analysts said.
    Feretti conservatively estimated Tenneco's breakup value at
58 dlrs a share and said the company generated a cash flow of
about 10 dlrs a share ""which is probably very attractive to
Pickens."" Other analysts, however, estimate a breakup value
well into the 60 dlr a share range.
    ""I strongly doubt that there is going to be any hostile
takeover,"" Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's Houston-based analyst
John Olson said, putting little credence in the rumors.
    ""Tenneco is a gargantuan enterprise with seven billion dlrs
in long-term debt and preferred stock outstanding."" He said the
buyer would also have to deal with ""the intractable problems""
Tenneco faces with its farm equipment unit and energy
businesses.
    Analysts suggested that Tenneco could use a number of
defensive strategies to fend off an unwanted buyer, such as
spin off some of its non-energy businesses directly to
shareholders, buy back shares or create a limited partnership
out of its natural gas pipeline interests.
    An analyst who asked to remain unidentified, discouraged
the Pickens rumor. ""Pickens has a plateful already with his
holdings in Burlington Northern and Amerada Hess,"" he said. ""I
don't think he would be willing to take on Tenneco's problems
with Case (the farm equipment unit), which has been losing
about 180 mln dlrs annually and is worth less than a billion
dlrs on the market today.""

68 pct.
    The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and a

    Proceeds from sale of the shares, priced at 5.625 dlrs
each, will be used to buy and deliver 4,985,000 ounces of
silver to Placer, Equity said.
    Equity Silver said the silver remains to be delivered under
its sale agreement with Placer, after delivery of its 750,000
ounce minimum commitment for 1987.
    Equity said it arranged to acquire 4,985,000 ounces of
silver at 7.40 dlrs an ounces, subject to selling the shares to
Placer.
    Purchase and delivery of the silver to Placer will result
in an after-tax gain of about 6.6 mln dlrs, Equity said.
    It also said the stock and silver transactions will create
a 37,059,000 dlr fund out of which dividends will be paid when
cash is available.
    The cash fund will enable Equity Silver to continue to pay
dividends on its preferred shares and increase the likelihood
that it may be able to pay dividends on its common shares, the
company said.
    It did not elaborate on what common share dividends might
be paid.
    The company normally pays quarterly preferred dividends
totalling 619,000 dlrs from retained earnings, Equity Silver

<title>HUGHES &lt;HT&gt; APPROVES MERGER WITH BAKER &lt;BKO&gt;</title>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, March 11 - </dateline>An overwhelming majority of Hughes Tool
Co shareholders approved a merger agreement with Baker
International Corp based on revised terms that allow the
companies additional time to sell a drilling bit business as
required by the U.S. Justice Department.
     Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of
the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how
much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on
the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold.
    An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a
funding limit.
    The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2
billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell through
earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed
Justice Department consent decree that would have given the
companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed
business.
    Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr
lawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with the
merger.
    Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct of
Hughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revised
terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a
buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous
agreement had proposed a three-month period.
    Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would
consider granting, if necessary, an additional three-month
extension to complete the sale.
    He said there were ""several people looking"" at the domestic
drilling bit business.
    The companies, Kistler said, have also decided to
voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore.
    Kistler estimated that the merger, which should be
completed in about two weeks, will result in annual cost
savings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects ""substantial
cutbacks"" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc,
the name the merged company will take.
    Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies
should put the company on a profitable course. ""We think that
in the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should see
something close to breakeven,"" he said.
    In the fourth quarter of 1986, Hughes earned 31.7 mln dlrs
on sales of 215.7 mln dlrs.
    Baker, in its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, lost
34.2 mln dlrs on revenues of 297.7 mln dlrs.

<dateline>   LONDON, March 11 - </dateline>The Bank of England does not favour the
introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover
attempts, its governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said.
    Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must
show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that
have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and
Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries' annual
dinner.
    Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties
with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of
those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors
of companies they invest in.
    ""Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,
for that is but a short step from saying that they should be
protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all,
the proprietors of the company,"" Leigh-Pemberton said.
    He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to
play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more
efficient market penetration. ""The degree of success or failure
(of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or
not the takeover was contested,"" he said.
    Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover
activity in the recent past. ""The aim is to pressurise a
company's management into action dedicated solely to a
favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly
or even primarily at the expense of the future,"" he said.
    Such bids ""often depend for their success on creating a
highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market,
and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to
engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are
immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders,"" he
said.
    In a clear reference recent events, he said ""those in the
City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest,
be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if
it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result.""

<title>INVESTORS TO RAISE CYCLOPS &lt;CYL&gt; TENDER PRICE</title>
<dateline>    DAYTON, Ohio, March 12 - </dateline>Cyacq Corp, an investor group
bidding for Cyclops Corp, said it would raise its outstanding
tender offer price for Cyclops common to 92.50 dlrs a share
from 80 dlrs, if certain conditions were met.
    The increased offer would exceed the 90.25 dlrs a share
price offered by Dixons Group PLC in a tender offer for Cyclops
that is part of a definitive agreement to acquire the
Pittsburgh-based maker of carbon tool and specialty steel
products.
    Cyacq includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and Citicorp
Capital Investors Ltd and other investors.
    Cyclops has about 4.1 mln shares outstanding.
    For the tender price to be raised, Cyclops must provide
Cyacq with all non-public information provided to Dixons Group
and Cyacq must be satisfied with financial projections made in
offering material by Dixons based on the information, Cyacq
said.
    Additionally, Dixon Group's rights to buy Cyclops common
and its rights to fees or expenses if the Dixon-Cyclop merger
agreement is broken must be rescinded, Cyacq said.
    Cyacq said financial projections it developed for Cyclops
were materially lower than the financial projections provided
by Cyclops to Dixons Group.
    A Cyclops spokeswoman said the company had no details of
the new Cyacq proposal and could not comment. ""We have nothing
in hand,"" she said.
    In addition to making specialty metal products, Cyclops
also operates about 115 specialty stores that sell consumer
electronics products. The stores are located in 17 states
concentrated in the Northeast, Northwest and Southwest.
    Cyclops employs about 8,900 people in Pennsylvania, Ohio
and other states. It also has interests in non-residential
construction.
    In 1986, Cyclops earned 21.3 mln dlrs or 5.26 dlrs a share
on sales of 1.5 billion dlrs, compared to 1985 earnings of 26.2
mln dlrs or 6.20 dlrs on sales of 1.4 billion, the spokeswoman
said.
    The agreement with Dixons Group calls for Cyclops's steel
and construction businesses to be sold to a unit of Alleghany
Corp &lt;Y&gt; for about 110 mln dlrs once the merger is completed.
    A Cyacq spokesman said the new conditional tender price

pact in Caracas on March 17 with Petroleos De Venezuela, PDVSA,
to sell the state owned company half of its Corpus Christi,
Texas refinery owned by its Union Pacific's Champlin Petroleum
Co subsidiary.
    The sale will also include the related marketing and
distribution system for the refinery's products.
    A spokesman for the company said that a statement may be
issued later today giving details of the transaction.
    There was no immediate comment from PDVSA officials in New
York.
    The Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of about 160,000
barrels per day, the Union Pacific spokesman said, and is a
largely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the
transaction.
    The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution
assets by PDVSA has been expected as Venezuela has been moving
aggressively to enhance its role in the oil industry from
producer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector.
    Purchase of part of Champlin's operations also fits a
profile which PDVSA officials have said previously they looked
for in any acquisition.
    One PDVSA official said the company was looking for
independent oil companies with good refinery and distribution
network and a strong regional presence.
    The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed
its earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp's
&lt;SLC&gt; Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary.
    In that agreement signed September 15, 1986, PDVSA paid
Southland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgo's stock.
    The potetnital acquisition of half Champlin's Corpus
Christi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet for
its crude oil production while giving the refiner an assured
source of supply, trade sources said.

    Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firm
associated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelity
companies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said he
personally owns 20,000 shares.
    A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the
letter from Gardner.
    Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service
may emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before the
transaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had also
speculated another courier company would be the most likely
suitor.
    While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no
new bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushed
the stock into play again.
    ""There's no shortage of possibilities. It's just a question
of management's willingness to let the process continue,"" said
one arbitrager.
    Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they
believe Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction.
Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs
cash per share. The balance of Purolator's stock will be bought
for securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S.
courier operations.
    The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that
Hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and
will emerge with a giant, majority equity interest in
Purolator.
    ""As far as I can tell from the public documents from the
deal that's on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero.
One always likes a situation like that. You always like to
think if they can do this deal at no risk, there should be
someone else in the world that could do it higher,"" said one
arbitrager.
    The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, and
sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the
firm will not end up paying for its equity position.
    While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document
did note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to
keep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is some
risk to the firm.
    ""There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash,
and all sorts of things that make it very speculative,"" said
one of the sources, adding there are also severance payments to
employees.
    The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs
in so-called ""bridge"" financing for the transaction. The bridge
financing is a temporary loan from Hutton.
    The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing,
expected to come from banks. However, it may take some time to
replace the financing, the source said, resulting in what could
be a substantial expense to the firm.
    Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln
dlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transaction
said fees are at the low end of the scale.
    ""It's a very complex transaction, but basically what
happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture
any investment they might have once the merger takes place,""
Gardner said.

<title>ALLIED-LYONS SEES NO CHANGE IN HIRAM WALKER STAKE</title>
<dateline>    TORONTO, March 12 - </dateline>Allied-Lyons PLC &lt;ALLD.L&gt; and Canada's
Reichmann brothers are working well together as partners and
currently do not plan any change in their joint ownership of
distiller Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts, Allied-Lyons
chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said.
    Allied-Lyons got 51 pct control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham
last year for about 600 mln U.S. dlrs, while the Reichmanns'
&lt;Gulf Canada Corp&gt; acquired 49 pct in an out-of-court pact
after a hostile battle for the wine and spirits division of
&lt;Hiram Walker Resources Ltd&gt;.
    ""We are getting along very well as partners ... I hope
there won't be any change, but there could be,"" Holden-Brown
told reporters after a speech in Toronto.
    He said Allied-Lyons has a two-year call option that could
force Gulf Canada to sell its 49 pct stake to Allied-Lyons, and
Gulf Canada has a two-year put option that could obligate
Allied-Lyons to buy its 49 pct.
    ""Both we and Gulf hope very much there will be no occasion
for either the put or call to be exercised,"" Holden-Brown said.
    In answer to a reporter's question, Holden-Brown said it
would be possible for Gulf Canada to sell off part of its 49
pct in a public offering with Allied-Lyons' consent. ""I don't
think we would have any objection to it,"" he added.
    Allied-Lyons maintains control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham's
board of directors and has total responsibility for its
management. ""We cannot contemplate giving up our control,"" he
said.
    Holden-Brown would not disclose how big a profit
contribution the distiller will make in Allied-Lyons' financial
results, but he said ""it will be substantial.""
    ""I am not able to give profit forecasts,"" he said.
    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons was able to finance the
Hiram Walker-Gooderham acquisition with cash and borrowings,
and has no current plans for a stock issue.
    He said the company is not currently negotiating any more
acquisitions in Canada but has a team of officials evaluating
possible purchases of wines, spirits, soft drinks or food
concerns. ""I don't think we shall be looking at the brewery
scene (which is) highly concentrated already,"" he added.
    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons plans to list its shares on
Canadian stock exchanges, possibly later this year.

<title>JAPAN REJECTS U.S. OBJECTIONS TO FAIRCHILD SALE</title>
<author>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 13 - </dateline>A Foreign Ministry official dismissed
arguments made by senior U.S. Government officials seeking to
block the sale of a U.S. Microchip maker to a Japanese firm.
    ""They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues,""
Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministry's North American
Division told Reuters.
    U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the
White House to consider blocking the sale of &lt;Fairchild
Semiconductor Corp&gt; to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T&gt;, U.S.
Officials said yesterday.
    Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the
U.S. Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high
technology equipment. Pentagon officials said Defence Secretary
Caspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale.
    U.S. Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a
powerful role in the U.S. Market for supercomputers while
Japan's supercomputer market remains closed to U.S. Sales.
    Takemoto said national security should not be an issue
since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner,
Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB&gt;, does not include Fairchild's main
defence-related division.
    In addition, Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer
trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make
supercomputers.
    Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated
microchips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chips
and supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers, they said.
    Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposed
takeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law, saying ""the purchase
would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductor
market.""
    Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost
pressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said.
    The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its
domestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales, they said.
    U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese
public sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despite
U.S. Firms' technological lead in the field.
    ""The United States believes Japan will only react when
bullied, and this is a bullying ploy,"" Salomon Brothers Asia
analyst Carole Ryavec said.
    However, the analysts said more is at stake than
supercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vital
semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors.
    ""The real issue is xenophobia in (the U.S.) Silicon Valley,""
said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co.
    U.S.-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has
failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firms
to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing
and opening Japan's market.
    A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding
by the agreement, problems remain in halting the sale of
microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those
set by the pact.
    ""It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem,""
he told Reuters.
    Despite the furore, Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the
acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with
Schlumberger last year, a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Reuters.

<title>BALLY &lt;BLY&gt; CONSIDERING SALE OF SIX FLAGS</title>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, March 13 - </dateline>Bally Manufacturing Corp said it is
considering the sale of its Six Flag theme amusement park unit
and would use the proceeds to pay off debt.
    In addition to the possible sale of the amusement parks,
Bally plans to sell a minority stake in its health club chain
to the public. The company will register a proposed offering
with the Securities and Exchange Commission for 20 to 30 pct of
the health clubs soon, spokesman William Peltier told Reuters.
    ""Selling Six Flags is definitely under consideration,""
Peltier said in response to an inquiry. He said the company
would use much of the income from the amusement park chain,
were it to be sold, to repay debt.
    Six Flags might sell for as much as 300 mln dlrs, analysts
said. The health club chain, the nation's largest, is valued at
350 to 375 mln dlrs, they said.
    Bally reportedly already has been approached about Six
Flags by several prospective buyers.
    The company needs the cash to begin paying back a 1.6 mln
dlrs mountain of debt.
    Bally recently completed a 439 mln dlrs acquisition of the
Golden Nugget casino hotel in Atlantic City from Golden Nugget
Inc &lt;GNG.N&gt;.
    The purchase pushed its long-term debt to 1.6 billion dlrs,
or almost 2.7 times its equity of 600 mln dlrs.
    Bally's 325-unit health and tennis clubs had revenues in
1986 of more than 450 mln dlrs, or about 28 pct of Bally's
total revenues of 1.64 billion dlrs.
    Bally acquired Six Flags for 147.4 mln dlrs in January 1982
from Penn Central Corp. Bally bought the Great America theme
park in Gurnee, Ill., in May 1984 for 113.2 mln dlrs from
Marriott Corp &lt;mhs&gt;.
    In 1986 the parks had pretax operating profit of 48.6 mln
dlrs on revenues of 369.4 mln dlrs.
    The clubs and equipment unit combined to post operating
profit of 60.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 475.6 mln dlrs in 1986,
of which 456.2 mln came from the clubs.
    The company earlier this month said it will take a charge
to earnings in the first quarter of 17.3 mln dlrs as a result
of its deal to buy back 2.6 mln of its common shares from real
estate developer Donald Trump.
    Under a February 21 deal, Bally agreed to buy the 2.6 mln
of the 3.06 mln shares held by Trump at 24 dlrs a share, or
62.4 mln dlrs, plus 6.2 mln dlrs related expenses in exchange
for Trump not seeking control of the company for 10 years.
    The deal also requires Bally to buy Trump's remaining
shares for 33 dlrs a share if the stock price does not reach
that level by February 21, 1988.

<title>PDVSA TO SIGN CHAMPLIN REFINERY DEAL MARCH 17</title>
<dateline>    CARACAS, March 13 - </dateline>Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. said it
will sign a contract March 17 to buy a half interest in a
Corpus Christi, Texas refinery and related operations.
    The contract, to be signed by PDVSA and Champlin
Petroleum's parent company, the Union Pacific Corp, will create
a new joint venture called Champlin Refining.
    The state oil company said PDVSA will pay on the order of
30 mln dlrs for the half interest in Champlin.
     Energy minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said Wednesday
the cost would be 33 mln dlrs in cash, plus an additional 60
mln in crude and refined oil shipments.
    PDVSA and Union Pacific have sought a line of credit from a
group of North American and Japanese banks to finance the new
company's working capital, the Venezuelan company said.
    Under the deal, PDVSA will supply up to 140,000 barrels a
day to the refinery with the option to place 50,000 bpd more -
mostly gasoline and distillates - through Champlin's
distribution system in 10 U.S. states.
    The new company will be directed by a six-member board,
with three representatives each from PDVSA and Union Pacific.
    According to PDVSA, Venezuelans will occupy such key
positions such as treasurer and vice-president for
manufacturing.
    The total capacity of the Champlin refinery is 160,000 bpd
of crudes and another 40,000 bpd of intermediates. The plant
will be able to handle 110,000 bpd of Venezuelan heavy crudes,
which make up more than half of the country's crude oil
exports.

<title>BOND DEFERS RIGHTS ISSUE, MULLS PROJECT PARTNERS</title>
<dateline>    HONG KONG, March 16 - </dateline>&lt;Bond Corp International Ltd&gt;, a
subsidiary of the Australian-based Bond Corp Holdings Ltd
&lt;BONA.S&gt;, said it would defer its planned rights issue but
still wants the issue to be made before July 31.
    No date has been set for the issue, announced in January.
    In a document to shareholders, Bond Corp said the delay
follows its receipt of a 240 mln H.K. Dlr loan from its parent
company to meet the first payment on the newly acquired Bond
Centre commercial complex in central Hong Kong.
    It also wants outside partners to take up to 50 pct in the
project, the company said.
    The January announcement said the rights issue would
finance Bond Corp's 1.4 billion dlr acquisition of a 23.77 pct
stake in HK-TVB Ltd &lt;TVBH.HK&gt; from film magnate Run Run Shaw.
    The company then reached an agreement with a consortium led
by Sino Land Co Ltd &lt;SINO.HK&gt; to buy a commercial complex that
is still under construction for 1.9 billion dlrs.
    Bond International said in the document that except for the
240 mln dlr loan, the deal would be financed from internal
resources and by selling an interest in the building.
    The payments must be completed by the end of 1987.
    Bond International has also sold several residential
buildings in Hong Kong's mid-levels district for a total of
68.35 mln dlrs, the statement said.
    The flats were among the properties it bought last year
from Hongkong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HK&gt; for 1.4 billion dlrs.
    Analysts said Bond International is heavily geared as it
has relied on bank borrowings to purchase both the Hongkong
Land properties and the HK-TVB shares.
    Bond International also said in the document that while it
plans to sell an interest in the complex it will hold the
HK-TVB shares as a long-term investment.

<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 16 - </dateline>Schlumberger Ltd said it terminated an
agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd to buy 80 pct of its
Fairchild Semiconductor operations.
    The company said the rising political controversy in the
U.S. concerning the venture made it unlikely that the sale of
the Fairchild stake could be completed within a reasonable
time.
    The sale has been opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department
and the U.S. Defense Department, in part on national security
grounds.
    The company said termination of the agreement opened other
possibilities, including a possible leveraged buyout of the
semiconductor maker by Fairchild management.
    In the interim, Fairchild would continue its ongoing
business within Schlumberger, the oilfield services concern
said.
    Last October, Schlumberger announced the sale of the
Fairchild stake and said it would take a 200 mln dlrs charge in
the fourth quarter from the sale. The company ended up
recording special charges of 2.1 billion dlrs in the fourth
quarter, leading to a loss of 2.02 billion dlrs for the year.
    Schlumberger never announced a price for the sale, but
industry analysts have estimated the value of the deal at about
200 mln dlrs.
    The proposed sale was under antitrust review by the U.S.
Justice Department. Additionally, Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldridge and other U.S. officials have voiced reservations
about the transaction since it was announced.
    Government officials have expressed concern that the sale
could reduce the competitiveness of U.S. chip makers by putting
key advanced technology into Japanese hands.
    New, high-technology semiconductors are used in
supercomputers, which are faster and more powerful than
existing computers.
    Schlumberger is an oilfield services company controlled by

    In a brief statement announcing the termination of the
agreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger said the decision opened
up other possibilities, including a possible buyout by
Fairchild management.
    The company said it ended the deal, in which Fujitsu would
have bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs,
because rising opposition to the deal by the Reagan
administration made it unlikely that the sale could be
completed within a reasonable period of time.
    Analysts questioned this explanation, however, arguing that
the companies did not need government approval to complete the
transaction. Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-owned
companies.
    ""Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because
the U.S. government didn't want it,"" said Johnson of L.F.
Rothschild.
    A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on the
company's news release.
    He said only that the company was reviewing a number of
possible alternatives for the Fairchild unit.
    Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediately
available for comment.
    Analysts noted the significance of the government's
apparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control of
Fairchild.
    Administration officials, including Commerce Secretary
Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger,
feared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese control
of key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military
weapons systems.
    ""The government really stood up for the semiconductor
industry,"" said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. ""That, I think, is
the real significance of this.""
    Consequently, analysts said, the Japanese government might
now feel more pressure to address U.S. complaints about
Japanese chipmakers' violation of the semiconductor trade
agreement signed last summer.

<title>ICAHN SAYS HE IS TARGET OF SEC INVESTIGATION</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </dateline>Corporate raider Carl Icahn
acknowledged that he is one of the targets of an investigation
by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible
violations of securities laws.
    Icahn, who heads and controls Trans World Airlines Inc
&lt;TWA&gt;, made the acknowledgement in a filing TWA was required to
make with the SEC disclosing its 14.8 pct stake in USAir Group.
    The SEC issued a formal order launching the private
investigation on Nov 12, 1986, Icahn said in the SEC filing.
    The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find out
whether any persons, including Icahn, violated securities laws
and related rules, Icahn said.
    Specifically, the probe is examining the acquisition and
subsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certain
unspecified companies, he said.
    Federal law requires individuals or groups of individuals
who have made shareholder agreements, to disclose stakes in
companies of at least five pct within 10 days.
    Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed in
connection with SEC probes, but this is the first time he has
disclosed that he is among those being investigated.
    By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC, which is
obviously already aware of its own probe, Icahn was also
alerting current and potential shareholders of TWA.
    It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that they
or their officers are the targets of government probes to
acknowledge the existence of the otherwise secret
investigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirements
to their shareholders.
    Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and others
whom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring and
selling more than five pct of a company's stock.
    SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securities
law violations have been spawned by the agency's widening probe
into the Wall Street insider trading scandal, according to
published reports.
    Making late filings of 13D forms, which disclose the amount
of stock over five pct an investor has in a company, or making
no filing at all could indicate a scheme to ""warehouse"" shares
of stock.
    In a warehousing scheme, a group of investors acting in
concert would each amass stock in the company without
disclosing that they have an agreement among them.
    By failing to disclose that they are acting together the
market is unware of the amount of stock of a company that is
controlled by a group acting in concert.
    Last year, the SEC charged members of the wealthy Belzberg
family of Canada with taking part in a warehousing scheme while
it was accumulating stock in Ashland Oil Inc.

<title>FAIRCHILD DEAL FAILURE SEEN MAKING JAPANESE WARY</title>
<author>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 17 - </dateline>Schlumberger Ltd's &lt;SLB.N&gt; decision to
end an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T&gt; to buy
80 pct of its &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp&gt;, and the political
furore that surrounded the proposed sale, will make Japanese
companies more cautious in their efforts to acquire U.S. High
technology firms but will not halt such attempts, industry
analysts said.
    The collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow to
Fujitsu but it will boost the cost of future U.S. Expansion by
the Japanese firm, said analysts polled by Reuters.
    ""The acquisition of Fairchild is not essential to Fujitsu's
North American operations, but it would have been a great
boost,"" James Capel and Co analyst Tom Murtha said.
    French-controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was ending
the agreement because mounting political controversy in the
U.S. Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake
could be completed in a reasonable time.
    The sale was opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department and
Defence Department, partly on national security grounds.
    Fujitsu's acquisition of Fairchild would have given the
Japanese computer maker control of a comprehensive North
American sales and distribution system and access to
microprocessor technology, an area where Fujitsu is weak,
analysts said.
    The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additional
microchip production facilities worldwide, eight of them in the
U.S., A report by the Capel firm said.
    ""It was an entry point, a port for semiconductors and a
marketing channel for other things,"" said Barclays de Zoete Wedd
analyst Rick May.
    Several analysts said the purchase would not have given
Fujitsu access to critical defence technology.
    ""(Fairchild) simply doesn't have key technology -- that's a
thing of the past,"" May said.
    The failure could be a blessing in disguise for Fujitsu as
it might have had to spend several hundred million dollars to
modernise Fairchild's production lines, Capel's Murtha said.
    The failure of the deal will doubtless encourage Japanese
firms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire U.S. High
tech firms but they are unlikely to stop, analysts said.
    Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costly
route of expanding its own production and distribution
facilities in the U.S., Although some said it could use the
estimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try to
acquire some less politically symbolic firm.
    ""It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions, but the
necessity of expanding their production and design capacity in
America remains,"" said Capel's Murtha. ""The Japanese will
continue to shop for bargains, but it will be harder to find
ones that are politically acceptable.""
    Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures or
smaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlash
that blocked the Fairchild sale, analysts said. ""They're not
going to slow up, they're just going to buy smaller pieces ...
Because of the political risk,"" said Barclays de Zoete's May.
    Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pct
shares in smaller U.S. High technology firms such as super
minicomputer makers, he said.
    Opposition of the sort that blocked Fujitsu could end up
harming U.S. Firms and undermining a trend toward multinational
tie-ups, some analysts said.
    ""This is not really of benefit to U.S. Firms either,"" said
Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. ""The
pooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move --
why should the government step in to prevent it?""
    Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry Hajime
Tamura told a press conference that interference by U.S.
Government officials in the Fairchild deal was inappropriate.
    ""This is entirely a private sector matter and not a matter
for governments' comment,"" Tamura said. ""I think it was improper
for U.S. Government officials to intervene to the extent they
did,"" he said.
    A spokesman told Reuters the ministry's view is that
international investment flows ought to be free and that such
flows are of increasing importance in line with the growing
closeness of U.S.-Japanese economic ties.

<title>ATT-PHILIPS BID FOR CGCT OUTLINED</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, March 17 - </dateline>American Telephone and Telegraph Co and

direct and indirect holdings in France's &lt;Cie Generale de
Constructions Telephoniques&gt; if a joint bid with French
partners for the soon-to-be-privatised firm succeeds, a
director at one of the partner firms said.
    Marc Mathieu of &lt;Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications&gt;
SAT, told journalists the bid foresaw a direct stake of 20 pct
for APT, the joint firm set up by the U.S.'s ATT &lt;T.N.&gt; and the
NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PGLO.AS&gt;.
    The other 80 pct would be owned by a holding company made
up of SAT, APT, Cie du Midi &lt;MCDP.PA&gt; and five mutual funds.
   Under French law, foreign investors are restricted to a 20
pct direct stake in privatised companies but can boost their
stake to 40 pct through indirect holdings.
    The make-up of the holding company, however, is subject to
close discussions within the government due to legal queries
over the nationality of the mutual funds, a Finance Ministry
official said.
    Although bought by French citizens they are managed by
foreign banks &lt;Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York&gt; and
&lt;Banque de Neuflize, Schlumberger, Mallet SA&gt;, controlled by
Algemene Bank Nederland NV &lt;ABNN.AS&gt;, an SAT spokesman said.
    CGCT, which controls 16 pct of the French public telephone
switching market, is to be sold by the government for 500 mln
francs by private tender.
    Five groups are bidding for the company and the government
has said it will choose CGCT's new owner by the end of April.
    APT vice-president Wim Huisman told a news conference a
capital increase was envisaged if SAT-APT wins CGCT, but
declined to give details or say how an increase would affect
foreign stakes in CGCT.
    In 1985, CGCT posted losses of 200 mln francs on sales of
three billion after 1984 losses of 997 mln francs.
    A joint SAT-APT statement added that buyers were committed
to investing 240 mln francs in CGCT research and production
plants. The APT-SAT offer includes a provision for CGCT to
produce APT 5ESS-PRX switching technology and adapt it to
French standards.
    The tender was launched after a 1985 draft agreement for
ATT to take over CGCT was abandoned following the introduction
of the French government privatisation laws which reopened
bidding among a wider range of applicants.
    Other candidacies to take over CGCT include West Germany's
Siemens AG &lt;SIEG.F&gt; allied with Schneider SA &lt;SCHN.PA&gt;

<title>TAFT &lt;TFB&gt; STOCK RISES ON PROPOSAL</title>
<author>    By Patti Domm</author>
<dateline>    New York, March 17 - </dateline>Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almost
three points today as its vice chairman and an investment group
proposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company.
    However, several arbitragers said they would shy away from
the stock at its current price levels since it is unclear how
high bidding for the company would go and whether the company
would agree to a takeover.
    ""There are too many uncertainties,"" said one arbitrager.
    Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4.
    Dudley Taft, Taft vice chairman, and Narragansett Capital
Inc said they sent a letter to the Taft board, stating they
were committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast company
and were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150
dlrs per share.
    The company responded that the proposal would be submitted
to the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet been
made on a sale of the company.
    ""Someone's betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs per
share),"" said one arbitrager.
    Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at current
levels, unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per share
range. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level
would be chancy since it will take a long time for any
transaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals
necessary for the broadcast properites.
    Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billion
dlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejected
the bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co,
its financial adviser. It said it would consider alternatives
such as restructuring.
    Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft,
which has two large shareholders in an investment group led by
Robert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American Financial
Corp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds
16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50
years ago, has about 12 pct.
    Lindner last week told the Securities and Exchange
Commission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft.
    ""I could see if things got really crazy that it might go
for 175 (dlrs per share),"" said one arbitrager, but he
speculated it probably would not even be taken over for more
than a price in the 160s.
    Another speculated that Lindner might bid, but he
speculated the investor would not really be interested in
running the company. Lindner was unavailable for comment.
    Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said
he had speculated the company might be considering a leveraged
buyout.
    ""Ideally, you'd have to break this thing up to satisfy all
the interests involved,"" he said, adding the two largest
shareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft.
    He said the highest takeover price he calculated for the
company has been about 140 dlrs per share, but that the highest
estimates on Wall Street have been about 160. He said the
latter would be based on more optimistic expectations for the
broadcast industry.

<dateline>    CHICAGO, March 17 - </dateline>Midway Airlines Inc, which has
frequently been mentioned as an acquisition target, said it
declared a shareholder rights plan.
    Holders will get a dividend of one preferred share purchase
right on each outstanding share of common stock.
    Each right, when exercisable, will entitle the holder to
purchase one one-hundredth share of Series C Junior
Participating preferred stock for 50 dlrs.
    The rights are intended to assure that all holders receive
fair treatment in the event of a takeover. The company said
this is not in response to a known effort to acquire control.
    The rights will be exercisable 10 days after a person or
group buys 20 pct of the company's common, or announces or
commences a tender offer that would result in acquisition of 30
pct or more of its common.
    Midway can redeem the rights at two cts each at any time
prior to expieration of 10 days after the acquisition by any
person of 20 pct or more of the companyt's common, it said.
    If Midway is acquired, each right will entitle its hodler
to purchase a number of the acquiring company's common shares
having a market value at that time of twice the right's
exercise price.
    The dividend will be payable to holders of record April
six, and expire 10 years later on April 6, 1997.

<title>ALLEGHENY BEVERAGE &lt;ABEV&gt; EXPLORES UNIT SALE</title>
<dateline>    CHEVERLY, Md., March 17 - </dateline>Allegheny Beverage Corp said it
has been approached by a group interested in acquiring its
foodservice unit, Service America Corp.
    The group includes senior management of Service America but
no officers of Allegheny Beverage, the company said.
    The company has agreed to permit the group and its
potential lenders to perform a due diligence review of Service
America, it said.
    Allegheny noted it had previously cancelled plans to spin
off the foodservice subsidiary.
    The company said the group's review is preliminary and
there is no assurance that an acquisition proposal will be made
or, if made, accepted.
    Service America had fiscal 1986 revenues of about 934 mln
dlrs, or about 83 pct of Allegheny Beverage's total revenues of
1.13 billion dlrs for the year ended March 29, 1986, a
spokesman for Allegheny Beverage said.
    He declined to identify the Service America officials in
the acquisition group.
    On Feb 18, 1987, Allegheny said it was cancelling the spin
off of Service America, but gave no reason for doing so. It
said it would place major emphasis on managing Service America
to improve operations and increase earnings at the unit.
    Service America, which Allegheny acquired in May 1985,
operates cafeterias and food and beverage vending machines.
Through other subsidiaries, Allegheny provides coin-operated
laundry services, building maintenance services and retail
office and furniture operations.
    In fiscal 1986, Allegheny reported earnings from continuing
operations of 8.2 mln dlrs or 1.09 dlrs a fully diluted share,
excluding income of 59.7 mln dlrs from discontinued operations
and an extraordinary loss of 8.1 mln dlrs. In May 1985,
Allegheny sold its Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co unit to Pepsico Inc
&lt;PEP&gt; for 160 mln dlrs.
    Including discontinued operations and the special item, net
income was 59.8 mln dlrs or 6.21 dlrs a share fully diluted.

<title>PERU TO SELL 40 STATE FIRMS TO CUT BUDGET DEFICIT</title>
<dateline>    Lima, march 17 - </dateline>peru will sell about 40 state-owned firms
to trim a projected 740 mln dlrs loss this year among
government-owned companies.
    Some companies would be sold in their entirety and others
would be privatised only partially, according to jose palomino,
president of the government's state company holding firm, the
national development council (conade).
     He told reporters in a radio interview that the aim was to
slim a projected public sector firm deficit of 11 billion
intis. He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy all
or part of the companies.
    Independent economists warn that the deficit could push
inflation to between 60 and 100 pct in 1987, against the
govenment target of 40-50 pct.
    Palomino said aeroperu, the government flagship airline
with a 10-jet fleet, would issue stock for purchase by private
investors. The company in 1986 registered its first profit in
eight years, earning about 44.6 mln intis in pre-tax profits.
    Peru has about 140 non-financial state firms. Palomino said
the government would soon publish a list of those to be sold,
including those whose shares would be offered on the lima stock
exchange.
    Last november, palomino said conade's plans included the
possible sale of a company producing palm oil and another
manufacturing electrical appliances. Shares could also be sold
in a copper mine, empresa nacional tintaya sa, in the southern
state of  arequipa.
    Neither Palomino nor conade's general manager, enrique
estremadoyro, were available for comment on whether foreigners
would be allowed to purchase the companies. Their secretaries
said they were out of their offices.
    Jose antonio almenara, the general manager of the lima
stock exchange, where shares of the state-owned firms could be
sold, told reuters that the only foreigners who could purchase
stock at the exchange had to be tax-paying residents of peru.
    He said foreign stockholders cannot remit profits abroad
until at least july 1988.

<title>PAPER SAYS U.S. MAY SEEK TO CURB FOREIGN TAKEOVERS</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </dateline>The Reagan administration will
consider curbing foreign takeovers of security-sensitive
industries such as semiconductors and computers, the New York
Times said, quoting an unnamed senior administration official.
    ""I think there's a strong sentiment here that some
industries are not totally up for grabs,"" the paper quoted the
official as saying.
    ""Two of the most visible (industries) are semiconductor and
computer companies,"" said the official, who the newspaper said
was a central figure in the opposition to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd
&lt;ITSU.T&gt; takeover bid for &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp&gt;.
    The Fairchild-Fujitsu deal was abandoned on Monday, and
industry analysts said the move was a victory for the Reagan
administration in its drive to beat back Japanese competition
in the important computer chip manufacturing industry.
    Officials told Reuters last week that Commerce Secretary
Malcolm Baldrige and Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger fought
the planned sale of Fairchild by French-controlled Schlumberger
Ltd &lt;SLB&gt; to Japan's largest computer maker because it could
have left the U.S. Military dependent on foreign sources for
vital technology.
    The New York Times quoted Baldrige as saying the time had
come to limit takeovers in security-sensitive areas.
    ""Everybody wants an open investment policy, but there have
to be some exceptions for the national interest,"" Baldrige was
quoted as saying.
    The newspaper said Baldrige and Weinberger are expected to
bring the takeover issue before a top-level interagency
policymaking group, such as Treasury Secretary James Baker's
Economic Policy Council or the president's National Security

<title>PHILIPPINES SOCIAL SECURITY TO BUY SAN MIGUEL SHRS</title>
<dateline>    MANILA, March 18 - </dateline>The Philippines' Social Security System
(SSS) is planning to buy eight mln shares in diversified brewer
&lt;San Miguel Corp&gt; (SMC), SMC chief financial officer Ramon del
Rosario said.
    He told reporters the government organisation had expressed
interest in one seat on SMC's 15-man board and was preparing to
invest 800 mln pesos, assuming a purchase price of 100 pesos a
share.
    The shares involved in the proposal were part of the block
of 38 mln shares owned by the United Coconut Planters Bank
(UCPB) and sequestered by the government.
    The block is split between class A and class B stock.
    SMC also proposed to sell a further five mln shares to A.N.
Soriano Corp, the family company of San Miguel president Andres
Soriano, del Rosario said.
    The shares are worth some 500 mln pesos at recent prices.
    Del Rosario said the 14 mln B shares in the block which are
open to foreign ownership would probably be sold to
unidentified foreign purchasers.
    He said SMC and UCPB would meet later this week to try to
resolve disputes over the pricing of the shares.
    President Corazon Aquino earlier this month established an
arbitration panel to settle a row over the disposal of the
shares.
    Their initial sale to Soriano through SMC Hong Kong unit
Neptunia Corp was blocked by the Presidential Commission on
Good Government.
    The commission sequestered the stock on suspicion that the
real owner of the block was Eduardo Cojuanco, the former
chairman of San Miguel and the UCPB and a close associate of
deposed former president Ferdinand Marcos.

<title>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN BUYING OVERSEAS FIRMS</title>
<author>    By JEFF STEARNS, REUTERS</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 18 - </dateline>More U.S. And European firms will be
falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and
eager to extend their reach further overseas, according to
merger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters.
    Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S.
Banks, steel and other businesses.
    In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T&gt; -- Japan's
biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for &lt;Fairchild
Semiconductor Corp&gt;, a U.S. Microchip maker which supplies
components for supercomputers.
    Nomura Securities Co Ltd &lt;NMSC.T&gt; and Daiwa Securities Co
Ltd &lt;DSEC.T&gt;, Japan's two largest brokerage firms, are seeking
a niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while the
country's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas
banking, the takeover specialists said.
    Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporating
in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, all
have foreign businesses on their shopping lists.
    Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the most
pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto
makers they subcontract for as these move offshore.
    ""The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up
potential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. --
Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal,"" a
takeover specialist at one trading company said.
    Japanese companies have become among the world's richest
after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed
against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months.
    But the yen's strength, which has also raised the costs of
Japan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into
its traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth,
the specialists said.
    Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more
barriers against Japanese exports.
    Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid
the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work.
Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer little
investment opportunity.
    ""Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, but
the recent economic factors have become a driving force,"" said a
banking industry source.
    So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious.
    While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number in
the thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have
totalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said.
    Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese
acquisition activity was originally expected five years from
now, but that time span appeared now to be too long.
    Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said.
    A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals
Inc's &lt;DIAC.T&gt; takeover bid for &lt;Sun Chemical Corp&gt; of the U.S.
Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, he
added.
    Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for
550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bid
for the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire
business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all
but its graphic arts-related businesses.
    Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon
by the Japanese, the trading company official says. ""Japanese
people don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicable
deals."" But now after some experience overseas, Japanese
companies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. ""This is
a healthy progression.""
    However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the
board meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns.
    ""Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a
large U.S. Or European corporation,"" one banker said. ""They will
expand their operations only gradually, a typical way for
Japanese business.""
    A foreign merchant banker also noted, ""There are not many
mega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the big
deals there have already been done.""
    But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of
Japanese companies, the specialists said.
    Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in
high-technology areas. ""Japanese companies had used technology
and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate
from that trend,"" one takeover specialist said.
    Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. If
these succeed, activity could build, the specialists said.
    But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait
until the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese trading
houses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages and
foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as
go-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.

of its bankrupt former local partner's manufacturing facilities

manufacture of car spare parts and other items, and generate
about 100 mln pesos in export earnings over five years.

by state-owned banks.

approved.
    Toyota severed ties with its Philippine partner of 20
years, &lt;Delta Motor Corp&gt;, in 1984 because the local company

changed in the planning. I still presume that it will take

    This banker said there would be no reason to postpone the
issue of the 10 mln VEBA shares for a few days. He added that
the consortium which is arranging the deal had completed its
preparatory work, although the price had not been decided.
    The VEBA share has been weaker ahead of the placement but
West German stocks have been generally bearish and news of the

Dixons now holds a total of 56 pct of the fully diluted

    The company said it is now entitled to subscribe for all

    Dixons said it has waived its condition that 80 pct of the

    Dixons launched the agreed 384 mln dlr offer on February 17

<title>AFG &lt;AFG&gt;, WAGNER/BROWN BID FOR GENCORP &lt;GY&gt;</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </dateline>&lt;General Partners&gt;, controlled by
privately-held Wagner and Brown and by AFG Industries Inc, said
it has started a tender offer for all common shares of GenCorp
Inc and associated defensive preferred share purchase rights
for 100 dlrs a share.
    GenCorp stock closed yesterday in composite tape trading at
90.50 dlrs a share, up two dlrs on the day.
    In a newspaper advertisement, General Partners said the
offer and withdrawal rights expire April 14 unless extended.
    General Partners said the offer is conditioned on receipt
of sufficient financing to buy all shares on a fully diluted
basis and receipt of enough shares to give General Partners at
least 51 pct voting power, again fully diluted.
    It said the offer is also conditioned on GenCorp redeeming
the defensive rights or General Partners being satisfied that
the rights have been invalidated and General Partners obtaining
from the Federal Communications Commission a special temporary
authorization allowing completion of the acquisition of GenCorp
shares.
    General Partners said it would set up voting trust
arrangements pending review of its long-form application for
FCC approval of its acquisition of control of GenCorp's
broadcasting subsidiary.
    The partnership said the offer is further conditioned on
GenCorp management withdrawing its proposals to amend the
company's articles of incorporation and code of regulations to
provide for an increase in authorized common shares, a
classified board of directors and the elimination of cumulative
voting.  The latter two changes would make it harder for
minority shareholders to elect directors.
    General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for its
shareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer.
    GenCorp has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding, making the
value of the offer about 2.23 billion dlrs.
    Last fall, AFG and Wagner and Brown offered to acquire
&lt;Lear Siegler Inc&gt; for about 1.44 billion dlrs but withdrew the
offer when higher bids emerged and due to complications of the
Tax Reform Act of 1986.  Lear Siegler eventually went private
for 1.66 billion dlrs.
    GenCorp is involved in tire and plasticmaking and aerospace
as well as broadcasting.  The company faces challenges to its
two television and 12 radio station licenses, partly becuase it
failed to inform the FCC about allegedly improper foreign
payments and political contributions.
    GenCorp has agreed to sell its New York-area television
station WOR to MCA Inc &lt;MCA&gt; for 387 mln dlrs and its Los
Angeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS&gt; for 217 mln dlrs.
An investor group challenging the Los Angeles license would
also receive 103 mln dlrs from Disney.
    For the year ended November 30, GenCorp earned 130 mln dlrs
on sales of 3.10 billion dlrs.
    A GenCorp spokesman said the offer came as a surprise and
the company was not yet in a position to comment on the bid.

<title>JAPAN TELECOM MERGER COULD INVOLVE U.K.,U.S. FIRMS</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 18 - </dateline>Cable and Wireless PLC &lt;CAWL.L&gt; and the
Pacific Telesis group &lt;PAC.N&gt; may take part in a proposed
merger of two rival firms seeking to enter Japan's
international telecommunications market, a senior industry
official said.
    Fumio Watanabe, head of a telecommunications committee with
the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), told a
news conference Japanese shareholders in the two consortiums
agreed that the U.S. And British companies will be invited to
participate in the new merged firm.
    The planned linkup will satisfy Tokyo's request that only
one private company should enter the market.
    The two consortiums, &lt;International Digital Communications
Planning Inc&gt; (IDC) and &lt;International Telecom Japan&gt; (ITJ),
were set up in 1986 to compete with monopoly &lt;Kokusai Denshin
Denwa Co&gt; (KDD) after the market was deregulated in 1985.
    Watanabe said the Post and Telecommunications Ministry
wanted only one competitor for the time being because of the
size of the Japanese telcommunications market and that foreign
investors will only be allowed to hold a minority stake.
    He estimated the two foreign firms' share in the merged
consortium at less than three pct and added that even the
largest shareholders could own only some five pct .
    Cable and Wireless and Japanese trading house &lt;C. Itoh and
Co.&gt; each have a 20 pct stake in the IDC consortium while
Pacific Telesis and Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. &lt;MER.N&gt; jointly
hold 13 pct .
    ITJ is headed by a rival group of trading houses. Several
firms including Toyota Motor Corp. &lt;TOYO.T&gt;  belong to both.
    Watanabe said progress was being made towards a merger
agreement and added that Japanese industry agreed with the
government on having only one private consortium as two
companies might invest ""excessive"" amounts.
    He said talks with Cable &amp; Wireless will continue this

<title>GENCORP &lt;GY&gt; GROUP HOLDS 9.8 PCT STAKE</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </dateline>(General Partners), a Texas general
partnership equally owned by affiliates of Wagner and Brown and
AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG&gt;, said it currently holds 2,180,608
common shares, or about 9.8 pct, of Gencorp Inc's &lt;GY&gt;
outstanding common stock.
    General Partners said it began a 100 dlrs a share cash
tender offer for all of Gencorp, an Akron, Ohio-based concern,
that is worth nearly 2.3 billion dlrs.
    Gencorp, which has interests in tire- and plastic-making,
aerospace and broadcasting, has about 22.3 mln shares
outstanding.
    The General Partners offer is subject to receipt of
financing, a majority of Gencorp shares and other conditions.
    In a letter to Gencorp chairman and chief executive A.
William Reynolds describing the offer, General Partners said it
was willing to negotiate terms of the offer and was prepared to
meet as soon as possible.
    In a statement, General Partners said it has contributed
250 mln dlrs in equity financing and also has commitments for 
a one billion dlr credit line from Wells Fargo and Co &lt;WFC&gt; and
a 1.25 billion loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc,
a unit of American Express Co &lt;AXP&gt;.
    A Gencorp spokesman said the company's management was
meeting but that its board was not scheduled to meet today. He
said he was not sure the company had formally received notice
of the offer but was aware of it through press accounts.
    He declined to say what Gencorp's next move might be or
whether it would issue a statement later today.
    In the letter, General Partners said it plans to maintain
Gencorp's corporate headquarters in Akron, and retain the
company's plastics and industrial products businesses and its
tires and related products segment.
    The letter did not mention Gencorp's RKO General
broadcasting subsidiary, which has been involved in disputes
over license renewals at several of its television stations.
Gencorp has agreed to sell two of its independent stations, WOR
in the New York area and KHJ in Los Angeles.
    General Partners officials were not immediately available.
    Gencorp shares were delayed at the opening on the New York
Stock Exchange because of an imbalance of orders, and the NYSE
said the shares were indicated to open at 103 to 115. The
shares closed up two yesterday at 90-1/2, a new 52-week high.
    The financing for the offer includes the 250 mln dlrs in
equity from General Partners, the 1.25 billion dlr loan from
Shearson Lehman Brothers, a senior subordinated bridge loan for
which a binding agreement can be delivered within 24 hours
after a request from the partnership, and the one billion dlr
credit line from Wells Fargo.
    Wells Fargo has agreed to lend up to 250 mln dlrs of the
line itself and form a syndicate of banks to provide the rest,
the partnership said.
    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc will act as dealer manager in
the tender offer, it said.
    In the letter, the partnership said it was confident it
could obtain the financing and close the transaction promptly.
    Last fall AFG and privately held Wagner and Brown offered
to acquired (Lear Siegler Inc) for about 1.44 billion dlrs but
withdrew the offer when higher bids emerged. Lear Siegler
eventually went private for about 1.66 billion dlrs.

<title>SEC MOVES TO DISCIPLINE ALLEGHENY INT'L &lt;AG&gt;</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </dateline>The Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) staff is seeking authority to take enforcement
action against Allegheny International Inc, the
Pittsburgh-based industrial and consumer products firm said.
    Allegheny made the disclosure in documents filed with the
SEC in connection with its recent agreement to be taken private
through a leveraged buyout led by First Boston Inc.
    ""Following announcement of the merger agreement, the company
was informed by the Enforcement Division of the (SEC) that it
intends to seek authority from the commission to institute a
proceeding against the company,"" Allegheny said.
    ""The company is cooperating in the commission's
investigation which is continuing and now includes the taking
of testimony of employes and others,"" Allegheny said.
    In the ongoing probe, Allegheny said, the staff has asked
for information about company executive compensation and
benefit plans, certain company-owned real estate, travel and
entertainment spending and the use of corporate aircraft.
    It also has asked for information on acquisitions and
divestitures, the company's accounting system ""and other
internal controls,"" Allegheny said.
   The probe began in February 1986, Allegheny said.
    The SEC, as a matter of policy, routinely declines comment
on its enforcement actions.
    The SEC investigation began just months before Allegheny
became the target of a series of shareholder lawsuits claiming
that the company had violated the federal securities laws by
failing to disclose material matters in recent annual proxy
statements.
    The suits, later consolidated into a single class-action
complaint before a Pennsylvania federal court, allege
securities law violations involving numerous current and former
Allegheny officers and directors.
    Earlier this month, lawyers for the shareholders asked the
court to expand the charges to include an allegation that, in
the buyout, Allegheny had attempted to illegally freeze out its
public shareholders at an unfair price.
    Allegheny said it intends to vigorously defend itself
against all charges.
    The charges made in the shareholder suits are widely
believed to have led to last summer's resignation of Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Robert Buckley.
    In the buyout, a group led by First Boston tendered March
13 for all outstanding Allegheny shares at 24.60 dlrs a share.

<title>TALKING POINT/GENCORP INC &lt;GY&gt;</title>
<author>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    New York, March 18 - </dateline>The surprise 2.2 billion-dlr tender
offer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not be
enough to buy the company, analysts said.
    Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from General
Partners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of
GenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said  uncertainty
surrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to
Gencorp broadcasting licenses.
    Gencorp's stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading.
    ""The expectation is either there will be someone else or
the bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management's
cooperation,"" said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Hutton
group.
    Analysts said there is concern about challenges to
Gencorp's broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio
stations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years,
were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments
and political contributions.
    ""I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation,""
said Baker of the offer.
    Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue
might be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time
for any transaction.
    A source close to General Partners, however, said General
Partners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission
for special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations.
The source said if approved, the authority would allow a
transaction to be carried out.
    If it received the ""short-form"" approval, General Partners
would set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting
properties until the licensing situation is resolved.
    General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and
Brown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc.
    Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such as
General Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution of
the challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sell
the stations.
    GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt
Disney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV.
Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a
group that challenged the station's license.
    GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV in
Secaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs.
    General Partners said it intends to keep the company's
plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and
related products segment.
    Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said
that, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth as
much as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospace
business could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion
dlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting,
including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs per
share, he said.
    The company, formerly known as General Tire
and Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would be
worth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottling
business might also be worth several dollars per share, he
said.
    Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, who
became chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company's
Aerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp,
founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over the
years and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve.
    ""The management's doing a very fine job in trying to deal
with the non-strategic assets of the company,"" Rose said.
    Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, but
they declined to predict what steps the company might take.
They said it would be possible the company might consider a
leveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer.
    General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and there
was some concern about ""greenmail."" Greenmail is the payment at
a premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock.
    ""I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothing
surprises me anymore,"" said Rose.
    GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retained
First Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers.

<title>NORSTAR &lt;NOR&gt;, FLEET &lt;FLT&gt; OUTLINE MERGER</title>
<dateline>    PROVIDENCE, R.I., March 18 - </dateline>Fleet Financial Group said
that its board and the board of Norstar Bancorp have agreed to
merge the two bank holding companies in a transaction which
would create a 23 billion dlr asset bank holding company.
    Under terms of the transaction, each Norstar shareholder
will receive 1.2 shares of Fleet common stock based on the
number of Fleet shares after giving effect to a previously
announced April one Fleet stock split.
     The two-for-one stock split will increase Fleet's
currently 25.7 mln outstanding shares to 51.5 shares. There are
about 34.9 mln Norstar shares outstanding.
    Fleet said the deal is expected to be completed by July one
1988, the date on which the nationalization of Rhode Island's
interstate banking law takes effect.
    For the full year ended december 31, Fleet, a Rhode Island
based bank holding company, reported net income of 136.7 mln
dlrs and assets of 11.7 billion dlrs. Norstar, an Albany N.y.
holding company, reported net income of 104.8 mln dlrs and
assets of 11.1 billion dlrs.
     Fleet comptroller Irv Goss said it is estimated that the
transaction will result in minimal dilution in Fleet/Norstar
earnings per share. It is the intention of both companies that
cash quarterly dividends following the combination not decline
for either company's stock holders, the company said.
    For 1986, Norstar issued 1.31 dlrs annually in cash
dividends on its common stock. Fleet's current annual
distibution on a pre-split basis would be equivalent to 1.68
dlrs a share.
    In addition, Fleet and Norstar have each granted the other
an option to purchase such number of authorized buy unissued
shares of common stock, that will constitute 24.99 pct of the
fully diluted shares outstanding.
    The transaction is subject to both regulatory and
shareholder approval.
    The companies said that after the proposed merger, the
combined banking holding wil be among the 25 largest in the

earnings in transportation equipment and losses in steel
castings and forgings, which offset gains in the mining sector

<title>AIR CANADA COURIER BUY SHARPLY ALTERS INDUSTRY</title>
<author>    By Larry Welsh, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TORONTO, March 18 - </dateline>Air Canada's 54 mln U.S. dlr
acquisition of Gelco Corp's &lt;GEC&gt; Canadian unit has
dramatically altered Canada's fast growing courier industry,
largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, company
officials and analysts said.
    State-owned Air Canada takes over the country's second
largest overnight courier business just two months after
another Canadian company, &lt;Onex Capital Corp Ltd&gt;, approved the
acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New
Jersey-based Purolator Courier Corp &lt;PCC&gt;.
    But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by
financial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companies
and likely don't represent an industry trend toward buying out
foreign owned courier operations.
    ""It's a case of whether you can buy from the right people at
the right time,"" McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst
Tony Hine commented.
    The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S.
companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-off
their Canadian units to generate ready cash, said Nesbitt
Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin.
    ""There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parent
selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either being
under siege or taking someone else over,"" he said.
    Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd
as part of its previously announced program to sell off four
operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, Gelco
Express marketing vice president James O'Neil told Reuters.
    The sale is the first under Gelco's divestiture program,
and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs of
debt by year-end, the company said.
    While company officials declined to disclose earnings and
revenue figures, O'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant
position in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages a
day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs
a year.
    The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit
formed an important part of a company restructuring program,
adopted after another Canadian Company, &lt;Unicorp Canada Corp&gt;,
acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would
consider acquiring the whole company.
    Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company
formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of
Purolator's U.S. courier business.
    For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courier
business represents an ""excellent financial investment"" in a
market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesman
Esther Szynkarsky said.
    The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in
EMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service.
    It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky said
the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, and
the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs.
    She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy of
seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline
business.
    Gelco will continue to operate with current management,
independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada already
operates its own air cargo business that includes a small
door-to-door courier operation.
    ""They're well run, they're a good investment, they're doing
well in a growing market, and that's the way we want to keep
it,"" Szynkarsky said.
    Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units
will likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery
network, generating traffic for the former parent companies
without them having to tie up capital in Canada.
    ""The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is
incremental revenue,"" Hine said.
    ""It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put in
place the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuff
through, the more money you make,"" he added.

<title>U.K. TO SELL OFF REMAINING 31.7 PCT STAKE IN BP</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 18 - </dateline>The British Conservative government said
it would sell off its remaining 31.7 pct shareholding in
British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L&gt; during the next financial year
which starts on April 1.
    Treasury Financial Secretary Norman Lamont made the
announcement to Parliament. He said, ""The government's policy is
to sell its minority holdings in companies as and when
circumstances permit.
    ""As part of this policy I am now able to announce that,
subject to market conditions, the government will sell its
remaining shares in BP during the 1987/88 financial year.""
    The last sale of British government shares in BP was in
September 1983. The government currently holds some 578.5 mln
ordinary shares in the company.
    Lamont said the Treasury would appoint financial advisers
for the sale. Merchant banks and stockbrokers interested in
being considered for this would be interviewed in early April.
    In September 1983, the U.K. Government sold 150 mln shares
in an underwritten offer for sale by tender. The striking price
then was 435 pence - 7.5 pct above the minimum tender price, a
Treasury spokesman said.
    He said the sale of BP shares would not cut across the
government's plans to privatise Rolls-Royce, in either April or
May, or the sale of BAA Plc, the British airports authority
which is slated for privatisation in either June or July.

<title>FLEET &lt;FLT&gt; AIMS TO SPEED MERGER WITH NORSTAR</title>
<author>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </dateline>Fleet Financial Group hopes its
proposed merger with Norstar Bancorp &lt;NOR&gt;, ranked as the
largest U.S. banking merger, can be completed by the beginning
of 1988, according to an executive of Fleet.
    Robert Lougee, director of corporate communications for
Rhode Island-based Fleet, told Reuters the company is exploring
the possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger date
for the state's reciprocal bank law to Jan 1, 1988 from July
one. The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature.
    The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that
said the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would be
consummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate
banking outside of New England come down. ""If we can consummate
the deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,""
Lougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change in
the Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any other
banking institution in the state.
    He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law, which only
permits interstate banking mergers within New England, can be
amended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp.
    If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said,
an option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase
provisions.
    The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New
York as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled
up by the money center giants.
    Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet
and Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of
interstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain
permitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S.
Supreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers.
    Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed
merger as ""a partnership of two companies."" Both will continue
to operate existing headquarters after the merger.
    Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each one
of theirs following Fleet's previously announced two-for-one
split. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2, up 1/8, giving the
deal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs.
    That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-based
Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC&gt; and Seattle's Rainier Bancorpartion
&lt;RBAN&gt;. The West Coast deal, announced about four weeks ago, is
worth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs.
    Chemical New York Corp's &lt;CHL&gt; acquisition of Texas
Commerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billion
dlrs, making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainer
deal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co &lt;WFC&gt;
and Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrs
and there have been several bank mergers in the southeast
valued in the 700-800 mln dlr range.
    ""It's a merger of equals,"" said analyst John Rooney of
Moseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value at
the end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet's book
value was 28.02 dlrs.
    Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his
60's while Fleet's Terrence Murray is in his late 40's. He said
Kiernan would probably head the combined company until his
retirement then Murray could assume the top post.
    Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said
Fleet's earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986
on the basis of the merger terms announced today.
    He noted that Fleet has a ""teriffic reputation"" after
having diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet has
established consumer banks in the southeast and is known as an
innovator in securitization of mortgages.
    The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billion
dlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.  Norstar
operates in most of New York state but not in New York City.
    Lougee said at some point in the future banking operations
that both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine would
be combined.
    The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a
""lock-up"" option designed to deter other acquirers. Each
granted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissued
shares amounting to 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares
outstanding.

<title>GENCORP &lt;GY&gt; BIDDER PLANS SALE OF AEROSPACE UNIT</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </dateline>&lt;General Partners&gt;, controlled by
privately-held Wagner and Brown and by AFG Industries Inc, said
plans to sell GenCorp Inc's aerospace and soft drink bottling
divisions if it succeeds in acquiring the company.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
General Partners said proceeds from the sale of GenCorp's
aerospace division would help it repay some of the debt it
would incur in the 100 dlr a share cash tender offer.
    General Partners, which launched the surprise tender offer
today, said it already 2,180,608 shares of GenCorp, or 9.4 pct
of the total outstanding common stock.
    General Partners, which estimated the total cost of the
takeover at 2.5 billion dlrs, also said it plans to continue
GenCorp's policy of trying to settle Federal Communications
Commission charges against two of its television and 12 radio
station licenses.
    It said it would also continue GenCorp's policy of trying
to sell its New York-area television station WOR to MCA Inc
&lt;MCA&gt; for 387 mln dlrs and its Los Angeles station KHJ to Walt
Disney Co &lt;DIS&gt; for 217 mln dlrs.
    But General Partners said it plans to keep GenCorp's
headquarter in Akron, Ohio.
    General Partners also said it would maintain GenCorp's
plastics and industrial products division as well as tires and
related products.
    But it left open that it might make other changes in
GenCorp's operations after it completes the merger.
    Besides using 250 mln dlrs of its own equity for the tender
offer, General Partners said it would seek one billion dlrs
under a secured margin facility from Wells Fargo Bank N.A.
and other banks. It also said it would seek 1.25 billion dlrs
from the sale to Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc or its
affiliates of senior subordinated promissory notes.
    In a March 18 letter to GenCorp Chairman William Reynolds,
which was included in the SEC filing, General Partners
officials said they were ""confident of our ability to promptly
obtain the remaining funding as described in our offer
materials.""
    ""For this reason, we do not forsee any obstacles to a
prompt consummation of the transaction,"" General Partners said.
    Shearson is dealer manager of the General Partners offer
for GenCorp.

<dateline>    MIAMI, March 19 - </dateline>Solar Systems by Sundance Inc said it
agreed to buy a 45 pct interest in a company that will sell
condoms produced by INKEY SA of Spain.
    It said a spermicide used in INKEY's condoms contains an
ingredient that may help prevent the sexual transmission of
AIDS. The ingredient was cited in an article in the West German
publication, Aids Forschung. But it said the article was
about the ingredient and did not mention the spermicide or the
condoms made by INKEY.
    The company also said it is changing its name to
Eurocapital Corp shortly.
    Solar Systems said it was buying the 45 pct stake in a
U.S.-based &lt;Europharmaceutical Co&gt;. INKEY and an affiliate own
the remaining shares of the company, which was set up to
distribute condoms and vaginal products that are made, or are
being developed by INKEY.
    The agreement calls for a two mln dlr payment to Inkey for
the distributorship. The first 500,000 dlr payment is due 30
days after the products are approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. It said Europharmaceutical plans to soon file
with the FDA to market the condom, but expects the approval
process to be a lengthy one.
    The company said the active ingredient in the spermicide is
currently used in the U.S. in antiseptic applications unrelated
to condoms. As far as it knows, the ingredient has not been
tested in a spermicide.
    Inkey's condoms will be sold in the U.S. under the brand
name, ""Carlton."" The exclusive distribution contract for the
products runs for three years and is renewable for one-year
periods, the company said.
    It said the condoms are currently sold in Spain but have
not gone on sale in other European countries.
    It said Europharmaceutical currently does not have the
resources to make the payments under the distribution agreement
or fund the studies necessary to obtain marketing approval from
the FDA.
    The company also said Europharmaceutical is in talks to
acquire either one or more publicly held companies with little

<title>TALKING POINT/AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP&gt;</title>
<author>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    New York, March 19 - </dateline>American Express Co's plan to sell a
stake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be a
prelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit,
analysts said.
    American Express earlier said it has a general
understanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a
13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs.
    The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks,
as investors speculated on the possibility of more investment
in the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns.
    The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response to
the relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S.
firm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents a
price of 2.7 times book value.
    Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks,
depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insider
trading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8
times book value.
    American Express was trading today at 78-1/4, off 3/8. For
the last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors of
a spinoff of part of Shearson.
    Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit will
benefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasingly
important Tokyo financial markets.
    ""I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step,"" said
Long.
    ""What you will see probably in the future is American
Express selling an additional 17 pct in the public market and
have a public vehicle for Shearson,"" Long said.
    ""Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitment
into an illiquid situation,"" he said of Nippon.
    Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake in
Shearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, like
other investment banks, needs capital to expand globally.
    American express has said the total employees of shearson
will expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, that
number is substantially lower than growth last year, a company
spokesman said.
    American Express officials would not comment beyond a
statement made this morning. That statement, however, did not
close off the possibility of a public offering or other option
for Shearson.
    David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possible
Shearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believes
the firm will digest the Nippon investment first.
    ""I think they'll figure out what they're going to do with
the money they have,"" he said.
    Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also said
American Express could determine to sell shares to the public.
    In its statement, the financial services giant said it is
continuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition to
the investment by Nippon.
    American Express said options under study range from
expanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competition
to broadening its access to capital.
    American Express also said the options reflect the
continuing integral role of Shearson in American Express'
worldwide financial services strategy.
    Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding a
Japanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake to
Sumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion.
    Analysts speculated there will be more such matches.
    ""Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. They
don't have the money. There's just not enough internal capital
growth,"" said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows other
U.S. brokerage companies.
    Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, are
interested in the expertise of American brokers. ""Those
(Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies have
the capital needs and the growth opportunities to use the
money. That's a nice marriage,"" he said.
    Morgan Stanley and Co &lt;MS&gt; rose 4-1/4 to 74-7/8. First
Boston Corp &lt;FBC&gt; was up one to 51-1/4. E.F. Hutton Group &lt;EFH&gt;

will start taking over state-owned Sayam Bank Ltd and complete
the process in a year, Finance Minister Suthee Singhasaneh told
a press conference.
    He said the takeover decision was made this week to stem
the current heavy losses of Sayam and to avoid competition
between the two state-owned institutions.
    The minister said some of the existing 30 Sayam Bank
branches will be merged with their Krung Thai counterparts,
while others will continue operating but under Krung Thai's
name.
    Sayam Bank has existed since August 1984 when the Finance
Ministry took over and re-named the Asia Trust Bank Ltd.
    Sayam president Waree Havanonda told reporters last month
her bank posted a loss of more than 400 mln baht in 1986. At
the end of 1985 the bank, with 13.8 billion baht of assets, was
ranked 12th among Thailand's 16 local commercial banks.
    Waree said Sayam Bank was trying to recall about six to
seven billion baht of loans extended by its previous private
management and was taking legal action to collect another four
to five billion baht of doubtful debts.
    Krung Thai is Thailand's third largest bank.

<title>SWISS BANKER WANTS BOND RATINGS, SHARE DISCLOSURE</title>
<dateline>    ZURICH, March 20 - </dateline>A top Swiss banker called for an
obligatory, continuous rating for all Swiss franc bonds and
said he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a company
should be made to declare their share.
    In comments at a news conference of &lt;Vontobel Holding AG&gt;,
chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks'
own self-regulating bodies, such as the Swiss Admissions Board,
to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in.
    A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swiss
franc market and a debate on the use of registered shares to
prevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers.
    Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to the
market with ratings from the major U.S. Agencies, which were
readily available to professionals through specialised
information systems.
    ""We should make this classification obligatory and publish
it in places that are easily accessible to lay people,"" he said.
The quick changing nature of the financial market meant these
ratings should also be continually updated, he said.
    Vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies,
worried about takeovers, increasingly issuing registered shares
and participation certificates rather than bearer shares.
    However, both types of issue had a drawback, he said. The
recent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG &lt;JACZ.Z&gt; to take over Hero
Conserven Lenzburg &lt;HERZ.Z&gt; had shown the limits of a 1961
pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someone
who was not eligible according to the company's statutes.
    Excessive issue of participation certificates, which do not
carry voting rights, would also be contrary to the principle of
greater democracy in the new share law before Parliament.
    ""People buying, for example, more than five pct of a
company's shares should be made to declare their purchase,"" he
said.

about 29 years at a negotiated lease payment rate.

amount of annual revenue needed by about 20 mln dlrs. It plans

<title>ITALY SETS RULES FOR COMPANY HOLDINGS IN BANKS</title>
<dateline>    ROME, March 20 - </dateline>Companies will henceforth be able to own
stakes in banks, but these should not constitute a ""dominant""
holding, an Italian government committee ruled.
    The Interministerial Committee on Credit and Savings,
headed by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria, said its decision
reflected the ""need to safeguard the principle of separation
between banks and non-financial concerns.""
    It did not quantify what might constitute a ""dominant""
holding.
    The committee also set conditions for the allocation of
credits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes in
them, and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italy
could exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes held
by banks in companies or other banks.
    Under the ruling, credits given by banks or their
subsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or more
of the bank's capital must not exceed defined limits.
    The value of credits given cannot exceed either one-fifth
of the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself or
two-fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by the
group or individual concerned.
    Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concerns
in which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreign
banks. Credits made by foreign companies or banks to
subsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also be
excluded from the conditions.
    The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules in
their statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holding
five pct or more of the bank's capital are not given privileged
treatment with regard to credit allocation and terms.
    With regard to bank holdings in companies, the Bank of
Italy can exercise supervisory controls when information on a
bank's consolidated activities show single shareholdings in a
company or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly or
indirectly.

<dateline>    DAYTON, Ohio, March 20 - </dateline>Audio/Video Affiliates Inc said it
has filed suit against &lt;Dixons Group PLC&gt;, Cyclops Corp,
Alleghany Corp &lt;Y&gt; and others in connection with Dixons'
recently completed tender offer in which it raised its
ownership of Cyclops to 56 pct.
    The company said the suit, filed in U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of Ohio, seeks a temporary restraining
order and preliminary injunction requiring Dixons, for 10
business days, to permit any Cyclops shareholder who previously
tendered and now wishes to withdraw to do so.
    The company said the order and injunction would also
prohibit Dixons from exercising a ""lockup"" option granted it by
Cyclops and prohibit Dixons for 10 business days from
attempting to exercise any control over Cyclops.
    Audio/Video said the suit also requests the court to order
Cyclops to immediately provide to all potential bidders for
Cyclops all information given to Dixons.
    Audio/Video and Citicorp &lt;CCI&gt; have been tendering for all
Cyclops shares in a competing offer at 80.00 dlrs per share but
said it could raise its bid to 92.50 dlrs under certain
circumstances.  Dixons offered 90.25 dlrs in its tender.

<title>JAPAN, BRITAIN DISAGREE ON TELECOM MERGER</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 20 - </dateline>Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L&gt; is
resisting attempts to merge two Japan-based telecommunications
firms in the hope that overseas political pressure will force a
change in those plans, a company executive said.
    Cable and Wireless, which holds a 20 pct stake in one of
the two Japanese firms, is opposed to plans to reduce its share
to three pct in the merged firm, director of corporate strategy
Jonathan Solomon told reporters.
    That plan, put forward by a senior member of the powerful
business organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of the
Post and Telecommunications Ministry, has caused a storm of
protest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreign
firms from a meaningful position in the market.
    Pacific Telesis Group &lt;PAC.N&gt; of the United States also
holds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia,
&lt;International Digital Communications Inc&gt; (IDC).
    Solomon said that both British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz have
written to the Japanese government about the planned merger.
    A key U.S. Senate committee, Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have also
expressed opposition to the merger, he said.
    The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated again
that it sees no need for two competitors to &lt;Kokusai Denshin
Denwa Co Ltd&gt;, which holds a monopoly on international calls
from Japan. The ministry has also suggested that foreign
shareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm.
    In an attempt to hammer out an agreement, Solomon today met
Fumio Watanabe, the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrange
the merger. But the two sides remained deadlocked.
    At stake is C and W's 400 mln dlr project to lay fibre
optic cables between Japan and Alaska, to form part of its
global network.
    ""C and W wants to start right away on the project, such as
application and other procedures,"" said Watanabe, who is also
chairman of &lt;Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Inc&gt;. The Japanese
side is saying that the decision on such a plan should be left
with the new firm, after the merger.
    ""These decisions (on the merger) were made in consideration
of Japan's economic conditions and legal systems. I told him we
are not a colony or something,"" said Watanabe.

<title>AUDIO/VIDEO &lt;AVA&gt;SWEETENS BID FOR CYCLOPS &lt;CYL&gt;</title>
<dateline>    DAYTON, Ohio, March 20 - </dateline>An investment group led by
Audio/Video Affiliates Inc said it raised its tender offer to
acquire Cyclops Corp to 92.50 dlrs a share from 80 dlrs a
share.
    The group, Cyacq Acquisition Corp, also said it extended
the offer until April three, from March 20.
    The group said it added several conditions to its offer,
including receipt of all non-public information about Cyclops
that was provided to &lt;Dixons Group PLC&gt; in connection with
Dixon's competing tender offer for Cyclops.
    Cyacq's sweetened offer, totaling about 398 mln dlrs, tops
Dixon's offer of 92.25 dlrs a share, or about 388 mln dlrs.
    On Wednesday Dixon said it had bought 54 pct of Cyclops'
4.3 mln shares outstanding, boosting its stake in the company
to 56 pct.
    Earlier today, however, the Securities and Exchange
Commisssion ordered Dixons to extended its tender offer until
March 24.
    Cyacq said it hopes Cyclops shareholders ""will withdraw
previously tendered shares from Dixons' tender offer to take
advantage of Cyacq's higher offer.""
    The SEC's order came after Cyacq filed suit to block Dixons
from taking control of Cyclops and to force an extension of
Dixons' tender offer.
    A Cyclops spokeswoman said the company had no immediate
comment on the sweetened bid from Cyacq.
    Cyacq said its new offer is also subject to Cyclops
rescinding any agreements with Dixons under which the
U.K.-based firm would receive ""break-up fees"" or expenses from
Cyclops or could buy Cyclops common stock from the
Pittsburgh-based company.

<title>AUSTRALIAN OFFER FOR SAN MIGUEL SHARES</title>
<dateline>    MANILA, March 22 - </dateline>Diversified investment company, &lt;Ariadne
Australia Ltd&gt;, has offered 3.8 billion pesos for 38 mln shares
in the Philippine brewing firm &lt;San Miguel&gt;, a Manila newspaper
reported.
    The Sunday Times quoted a letter sent yesterday to
President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman, New Zealander
Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct
of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares from the
government.
    The presidential office and Ariadne representatives in
Manila were not available for comment on the report.
    The shares are the entire block seized by the government
from the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) on suspicion that
the real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco, the former chairman of
San Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed president
Ferdinand Marcos.
    The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14
mln class B shares.
    Government officials have said earlier that the more
valuable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners.
    The offer values each share at 100 pesos -- the price at
which the Philippine Social Security System suggested it might
buy eight mln class A shares last week.
    ""Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the
Philippines' yearly budget,"" Ariadne's Philippine agent Domingo
Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday.
    ""Mr Judge's objective in this investment is to make his
corporation's management expertise available to San Miguel so
that the company's assets can be fully utilised.""
    San Miguel, the country's largest brewer, is also one of
the major manufacturers of grocery lines.
    Panganiban is quoted as saying that San Miguel could tap
food and liquor distribution lines in Australia, Britain, the
U.S., New Zealand and Hong Kong through &lt;Barwon Farmlands Ltd&gt;,

Australia Ltd&gt;, plans to set up a branch in the Philippines to
fulfill a prerequisite for the takeover of the Philippine
brewing firm, &lt;San Miguel Corp&gt;, a Hong Kong newspaper said.
    The Hong Kong Economic Journal quoted a spokesman of
Australian stock broker Jacksons Ltd as saying that &lt;Barwon
Farmlands Ltd&gt;, a listed Australian firm of which Ariadne owns
a 30 pct stake, is planning a branch in the Philippines.
    He added Jacksons is arranging an offer by Barwon to pay a
total 3.8 billion pesos in cash for 38 mln San Miguel shares.
    Barwon is offering 100 pesos each for 24 mln class A San
Miguel shares and 14 mln class B stock. But the Jacksons
spokesman noted that the more valuable A stock would only be
sold to Filipinos or companies registered in the Philippines.
    He said Barwon has approached the Philippine government
which seized the block of shares from the United Coconut
Planters Bank, which is believed to be linked with the
country's deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.
    He added he expects a deal to be concluded between Barwon
and the Philippine Government in 14 days as it is the only
offer in cash, the newspaper reported.
    Hong Kong Economic Journal also noted stock market rumours
that &lt;Neptunia Corp&gt;, a Hong Kong registered company which
controlled by San Miguel's president Andres Soriano, is the
other party keen on the block of San Miguel shares.
    The Philippine's Commission on Good Government ruled last
May against a move of Neptunia to acquire 33 mln San Miguel
shares controlled by the brewery firm's former chairman Eduardo
Cojuangco, who is also chairman of United Coconut.
    Commissioner Ramon Diaz said at the time the government
would not allow a subsidiary to buy into a parent firm, adding
San Miguel could have offered the shares to other parties.
    The Manila newspaper Sunday Times published a letter sent
yesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman,
New Zealander Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent
to five pct of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares
from the government.

<title>DART GROUP FLEXIBLE ON SUPERMARKETS &lt;SGL&gt; BID</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 22 - </dateline>&lt;Dart Group Corp&gt; said it told
Supermarkets General Corp &lt;SGL&gt; it was flexible on the price it
would pay to acquire the company.
    Dart has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each SGL
share if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders.
    SGL has termed the 1.62 billion dlr offer unsolicited.
    In a letter to SGL dated March 20, Dart also said it was
denied confidential information on SGL that would be given to
other potential bidders.
    SGL officials could not be reached for comment.
    Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for the
sale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers,
but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access to
SGL's books and records and the opportunity to talk with key
employees.
    ""We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyout
firms,"" said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGL
management may be considering a leveraged buyout.
    Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a
friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all
the terms of its offer.
    Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not
received any other offer.
    It said it requested the confidential information to better
understand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to sign
an agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL without
SGL's approval.
    The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy
SGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditions
unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly
transaction, it said.
    Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares.
    Dart said it requested the information before its meeting
with SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope
representatives would reach an agreement.
    It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told
there were certain issues important to SGL management and while
they were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take
them into account in putting together its package.
    It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln
dlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vice
president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine.
    Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers'
severance agreements, although there was an implication that
Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their
own volition.
    Dart said under their present agreements, none of these
officers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also,
Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6
mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management's
incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost
of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares
unless waived by the company's compensation committee.
    Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top
management's supplemental retirement plan.
    Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance
obligations and future salary guarantees for top management,
estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations
under the company's present policy.
    Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed to
discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to
negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL.
    Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain
and Rickels home centres.
    Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed
by an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking such
actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence.
    The suit also sought to have directors carry out their
fiduciary duty.
    Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an
unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of
securities to shareholders which make a takeover more
expensive.

government, which holds the shares.
    It said it was confident the offer will be reviewed
favourably.
    Newspapers in Manila and Hong Kong reported at the weekend

    Barwon said it was represented by Australian stockbroker
&lt;Jacksons Ltd&gt;, which forwarded a formal offer to Philippine
President Corazon Aquino of 100 pesos for each of the 38.1 mln
A and B shares of San Miguel.
    The Philippine government seized the shares, which
represent a 31 pct stake in the brewery firm, from the &lt;United
Coconut Planters Bank&gt;, alleged by the government to be linked
with the country's deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.
    The Barwon statement said a deal is expected to be

    Barwon also said it made recommendations to the government
on how it could purchase the class A shares, which can only be

pct held by a member of the country. It did not elaborate.

<title>BEGHIN-SAY INCREASES CAPITAL TO FINANCE EXPANSION</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, March 23 - </dateline>French sugar group Beghin-Say, which is
49.6 pct owned by Italy's Gruppo Ferruzzi, is to raise its
capital to 703 mln francs from 527 mln through a three-for-one
issue of shares and investment certificates to finance
expansion, president Jean-Marc Vernes told analysts.
    For the first stage Beghin-Say will issue some 2.05 mln new
65 franc shares at 500 francs to increase capital to 660 mln
francs. The share currently trades at 734 francs. Then 658,000
new 65 franc investment certificates will be issued at 400
francs, raising capital to 703 mln francs.
    The capital increase will bring the group around 1.2
billion francs in new funds to finance its expansion plans.
These include the possible acquisition of the Corn Products
maize starch plant at Haubourdin in northern France, Vernes
said.
    Ferruzzi is one of several groups bidding to buy all of
Corn Products' installations in Europe. Apart from the French
plant, these include three factories in each of Italy and West
Germany, two in Britain and Spain and one in the Netherlands
and Denmark.
    Corn Products has put a 650 mln dlr price tag on the
installations, and Beghin-Say estimates that acquisition of the
Haubourdin plant would cost between 80 and 100 mln dlrs, Vernes
said.
    If this bid fails, Beghin-Say would consider acquiring and
developing two other French plants, either in the maize or
wheat starch sector.
    Beghin-Say is also planning to finance European expansion
for its Kaysersberg subsidiary, another major reason for its
capital increase.
    Kaysersberg, which was transformed from a division of
Beghin-Say into a fully-fledged chemical subsidiary last year,
has been holding talks with other European companies on
possible accords, Vernes said. He added the company could be
introduced onto the Paris Bourse in the near future.

for all GenCorp Inc shares at 100 dlrs each, said it has
started soliciting proxies against GenCorp's proposals to
increase its number of authorized shares outstanding, create a
board with staggered election dates and eliminate cumulative
voting.
    The proposals are to be voted on at the March 31 annual
meeting.
    General Partners, a partnership of privately-held &lt;Wagner
and Brown&gt; and AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG&gt;, made the disclosure in
a newspaper advertisement.
    The partnership has already filed suit in U.S. District
Court in Columbus, Ohio, seeking to block a vote on the
proposals and to invalidate GenCorp's defensive preferred share
purchase rights.
    General Partners asked shareholders to either vote against
the proposals or abstain from voting on them.

<title>USAIR &lt;U&gt; CUTS PIEDMONT &lt;PIE&gt; SHARES SOUGHT</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 23 - </dateline>USAir Group Inc said it has amended
its 69 dlr per share tender offer for shares of Piedmont
Aviation Inc to reduce the maximum number it will accept to
9,309,394. Previously it had sought all shares.
    In a newspaper advertisement, USAir said the offer and
withdrawal rights have not been extended and will still expire
April 3, along with the new proration period.
    On Friday, the U.S. Department of Transportation approved
USAir's acquisition of 51 pct of Piedmont. If USAir were to
acquire more than 51 pct in the tender, it would be required to
sell the excess within one week.
    USAir said receipt of the 9,309,394 shares -- which is also
the minimum amount it will accept -- would give it a total of
about 61 pct of Piedmont shares currently outstanding and 50.1
pct on a fully diluted basis.
    The company said even if the purchase of the 9,309,394
Piedmont shares caused it to exceed the 51 pct limit, USAir
would waive the condition to the offer that the Transportation
Department approve a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to
buy and hold shares under the offer pending review of USAir's
application to gain control of Piedmont, subject to the order
not being rescinded or modified in an adverse way.

said in a statement.
    Undertakings to accept what is effectively a management

    The offer will be of 345p cash for every Wickes share.
Wickes was last quoted at 345p compared with 275p at Friday's

    Wickes shareholders will also have the option of taking one
Cityquest share or 205p in loan notes for every 205p of the

<title>TALKING POINT/WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL &lt;WEN&gt;</title>
<author>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    New York, March 23 - </dateline>Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy's
International Inc's stock, even after Coca Cola Co took the
fizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested
suitor.
    Wendy's retreated from an earlier high of 13-3/8, and lost
a point when Coca Cola &lt;KO&gt; said the rumors were untrue.
However, Wendy's remained up 5/8 at 12-3/8 on volume of more
than three mln shares.
    Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet they
said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food
restaurant chain was impossible.
    Wendy's declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds.
Yet, a Wendy's spokesman said the company was aware of a
Business Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitor
and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill.
    Market sources mentioned Anheuser-Busch Inc &lt;BUD&gt; and
Pepsico Inc &lt;PEP&gt; as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neither
of those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy's
official.
    ""It doesn't happen every day, every week, every month, but
its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies,"" said
Denny Lynch, Wendy's vice president of communications.
    However, Lynch would not comment specifically on the
current market rumors.
    Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had been
skeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated it
views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become
a competitor to them.
    ""I can't put another name on it,"" said Kidder peabody
analyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up
Wendy's stock. ""It very well could be someone's interested.""
    But Freedman said he doesn't believe now is the right time
for Wendy's to be sold.
    ""They're obviously having operational difficulties. I've
always believed at the right price Wendy's would consider (an
offer), but I can't believe this is the right price at the
right time,"" Freedman said.
    ""If a transaction takes place, the buyer's going to control
the situation,"" Freedman said.
    ""I just don't think there's anything going on. I don't
think it's worth much more than where it is,"" said Joseph Doyle
of Smith Barney.
    Analysts said Wendy's has suffered largely from the ""burger
wars"" between itself, McDonald's Corp &lt;MCD&gt; and Pillsbury Co's
&lt;PSY&gt; Burger King chain. Wendy's, the third largest fast food
hamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same store
sales last year, analysts said.
    Wendy's also fumbled when it introduced a high-priced
breakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Some
analysts said the company should be bringing in new products,
but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround.
    There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy's may be
vulnerable to a takeover.
    James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy's could be worth
14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company has
improved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy's owns a high
percent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500.
    ""They also have some attractive leaseholds on their
restaurants,"" Murren said.
    Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year,
Wendy's real sales, store for store, turned upwards in the
fourth quarter. ""That was about the first time in seven
quarters,"" he said.
    Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something could
be going on with Wendy's. ""My gut feeling is something's going
to happen. I don't know what,"" she said.
    She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs
per share.
    One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor
because Wendy's decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead
of Pepsi.
    Wendy's is currently embroiled in litigation brought by
Pepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said.
Pepsi's soda is still sold in the Wendy's restaurants.

<title>DIXONS SAYS CITICORP TO WITHDRAW CYCLOPS OFFER</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 23 - </dateline>&lt;Dixons Group PLC&gt; said it received a
letter on March 19 from Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd, part of
the Cyacq investor group making a rival bid for Cyclops Corp
&lt;CYL&gt;, proposing to drop the group's offer if Dixons would sell
Cyclops industrial businesses to Citicorp.
    ""Cyacq's main equity investor appears ready to pull out and
deal directly with us for merely part of the company"" said
Dixons. ""It raises questions as to the strength of their
consortium and the purpose of their offer.""
    Dixons also said a U.S. Federal Court had refused a request
by counsel for Cyacq, Audio/Video Affiliates Inc &lt;AVA&gt; and a
shareholder plaintiff to prevent Dixons from
completing its tender offer for Cyclops. It also said the court
refused to require Cyclops to provide Cyacq with confidential
information previously provided to Dixons.
    On Friday Cyacq Corp, an investor group led by Audio/Video
Affiliates and Citicorp, raised their offer for Cyclops to
92.50 dlrs per share from 80 dlrs per share, if certain
conditions were satisfied.
    Last week Dixons said it won out over rival bidders for
Cyclops after getting 54 pct of Cyclop's oustanding with a

    On Friday, Dixons agreed to reopen its tender offer until

<dateline>    New York, March 23 - </dateline>American Express Co said its board
approved a public offering of about 18 pct of its wholly owned
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit.
    American Express also approved the previously announced
plan to sell about 13 pct, or 13 mln convertible preferred, of
the unit to Nippon Life insurance co for 538 mln dlrs. The
preferred shares are convertible to the same number of common
shares following Hart-Scott-Rodino and FDIC approvals.
    American Express said it will maintain 60 pct, or 60 mln of
the 100 mln shares of Shearson that will be outstanding.
    American Express said it had agreed with Nippon life that
American Express will hold a minimum of 40 pct of Shearson
until January, 1999.
   American Express said 7.5 mln Shearson shares would be held
by certain employees of Shearson and one mln by a Shearson
stock ownership plan to be formed.
    American Express said it anticipates a registration
statement for the public offering will be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission shortly.
    American Express also declared a two-for-one stock split
and raised its quarterly dividend to 38 cts per share from 36
cts on a pre-split basis. Both dividends are payable May 8, to
shareholders of record April 3. There are currently 215 mln
American Express shares outstanding.
    The transaction with Nippon Life remains subject to
approval by the Japanese ministry of finance, which is expected
in April.
    American Express also said an agreement was reached by
Shearson and Nippon Life providing for a joint venture in
London.
    The venture will focus on investment advisory asset
management, market research and consulting on financing. It
also said it expects the relationship to extend to selected
projects involving American Express, Shearson Lehman and Nippon
Life in key financial centers of Asia and other regions, and to
future personnel exchanges.
    Under the agreement, Nippon will receive 13 mln cumulative
preferred shares with a five pct dividend rate. The cumulative
preferred stock will become convertible with voting powers to
an equal number of common shares following the U.S. government
approvals.
    American Express said that assuming conversion of the
preferred stock held by Nippon, 100 mln shares of Shearson
Lehman common stock would be outstanding. For the public
offering, it said there will be an underwriters overallotment
option to purchase 1.8 mln shares.
    American Express will also grant Nippon Life a five-year
warrant to purchase one mln American Express common shares at
100 dlrs per share. There are currently 215 mln American
Express shares outstanding.
    Nippon Life would be entitled to nominate two directors to
the Shearson board and one representative to serve as an
adviser to the American Express board of directors.
    ""These proposed transactions are yet another signal that
american express intends to stay in the forefront of the
financial services industry worldwide,"" said American Express

    It said in a statement the Santos bid was below the
underlying value of the shares as assessed by Macquarie Hill
Samuel at between 4.08 dlrs and 4.72.
    TMOC, formerly the Moonie Oil Co Ltd, said the valuation
was made in response to an earlier and still current bid of
2.55 dlrs a share by &lt;Elders Resources Ltd&gt;. Elders Resources
holds 19.9 pct of TMOC's 62 mln shares.
    TMOC said it did not know Elders Resources' response to the

    &lt;Avalon Corp&gt; of the U.S. Has a 17 pct stake in TMOC

"<text>
<title>WILLIAMS HOLDINGS BIDS 542.2 MLN STG FOR NORCROS</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 24 - </dateline>Industrial holding company Williams
Holdings Plc said it was bidding 542.2 mln stg for the ordinary
shares of building products and packaging group Norcros Plc.
    The offer would be made on the basis of 29 new Williams
shares for every 50 in Norcros, or 432.7p a share
    Norcros shares firmed to 410p at 0914 GMT from a close last
night of 397p.
    A statement by Williams said it was confident of the merits
of the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care to
propose from the outset the right terms, including a full cash
alternative.
    The offer will include a partial convertible alternative
under which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205.69
mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of their
ordinary share allocations.
    The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers one
Williams preferential share for each one of Norcros, for a
value of 130p each and a total of 2.9 mln stg.
    Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986
rose to 22.9 mln stg from 6.3 mln.
    Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating in
the market for several months, dealers said. Initially it
centred on &lt;Bunzl Plc&gt;, which once held a 2.6 pct stake, then
switched to Williams when it began accumulating shares.
    Earlier this year, Williams suggested holding talks with
Norcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros which
replied that any benefits that could be achieved could also
result from normal trading.
    In the six months to end-September, Norcros reported a rise
in pretax profits to 20.14 mln stg from 18.55 mln on turnover
that lifted to 311.82 mln from 303.91 mln
    Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had a
market capitalisation of around one mln stg. A series of
acquisitions in the next four years has pushed its
capitalisation up to around 380 mln.
    The convertible offer would be on the basis of four
Williams convertibles for every Norcros share, worth 428p a
share. The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of
400.2p a share.
    The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price
down to 733p from last night's close at 750p.
    Williams said it held a total 850,000 shares in Norcros, or
0.7 pct, while an associate held a further 1.99 mln or 1.6 pct.
    There was no immediate response from Norcros.

<title>NIPPON LIFE, SHEARSON TIE-UP SEEN SETTING TREND</title>
<author>    By Steven Brull, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 24 - </dateline>Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr
purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers
are likely to follow, securities analysts said.
    The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses
is likely to pay off in dollars and international market
position, they said. ""It's part of a trend towards growing
capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign
financial institutions,"" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with
Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.
    The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described
by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give
Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on
Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its
assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.
    Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business
sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.
    The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50
joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset
management, market research, and consulting on financing.
    Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the
world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.
    The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the
deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life
insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.
    The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese
insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.
Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks
and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and
instruments.
    Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was
appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's
board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a
limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.
    Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and
problem-plagued banks in 1984. ""But now Japanese are going for
blue-chip organisations,"" he said.
    ""It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing
industries,"" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. ""With a
historically high yen, and historically low interest rates,
there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.""
    Competition in fund management has grown along with greater
Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln
yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17
to 18 pct, he said.
    To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and
gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to
spread to Japan with further deregulation. ""The high regulatory
environment has delayed (life insurance firms')
diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products
in an environment of increasing competition for performance on
fund management,"" Smithson said.

for Cyclops Corp, said it amended its outstanding 92.50 dlrs a
share tender offer for Cyclops to eliminate two conditions and
modify a third one.
    The group, which includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and a
unit of Citicorp &lt;CCI&gt;, said it also obtained additional
financing commitments, including an increased commitment from
Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd.
    The conditions that were eliminated are Cyacq's request for
non-public information about Cyclops that was previously
provided to Dixons Group PLC and Cyacq's being satisified that
the information provides an adequate basis for Cyclop's
published financial projections.
    Cyclops has agreed to be acquired Dixons Group, which has a
90.25 dlrs a share tender offer for Cyclops outstanding. Dixons
said earlier it would allow the offer to expire tonight.
    The condition that was modified, which required Cyacq to be
satisfied that break up fees or other obligations to Dixons
were rescinded or ineffective, now says Cyclops shall not have
paid any such fees or expenses to Dixons prior to the
consummation of Cyacq's offer.
    Cyacq's amended offer expires midnight New York time on
April three, 1987, unless extended.
    Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co and CIT Group/Business
Credit Inc increased its tender offer commitment to 197 mln
dlrs from 166 mln dlrs and its merger commitment to 275 mln
dlrs from 250 mln dlrs.
    Additionally, the Citicorp unit and Audio/Video have
increased their commitments to Cyacq to 185 mln dlrs. Of the
new total, 150 mln dlrs has been committed by Citicorp.
    Cyacq said it estimates that it needs 407.5 mln dlrs to buy
all Cyclops shares that may be tendered and pay related fees
and expenses.
    It said it is seeking to arrange the balance of about 25.5
mln dlrs necessary to complete the offer.
    All previously announced conditions regarding the lending
group led by Manufacturers Hanover remain in effect, except
that the loans are subject to the concurrent receipt by Cyacq
of equity contributions and other financing of not less than
210.5 mln dlrs for the tender offer facility and 213.5 mln dlrs

willing to bid 36.50 dlrs.
    For Conrac, the arbitrageur said, 28 dlrs per share seemed
like an ""appropriate price."" Another said ""it's too early to
project the outcome.""
    ""The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlr
offer is inadequate,"" the second arbitrageur said. But he added
it was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much more
than the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today.
    He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens and
there could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac is
able to thwart Mark IV.
    Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its board
studies the offer and confers with advisers. Conrac said it
would make a recommendation by April 17.
    A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved in
several takeovers previously and has proven itself to be a
determined bidder. ""They're not beginners,"" he said.
    Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to find
another buyer. ""It's a hodge-podge of non-related businesses,""
he said. ""There is only a small universe of people who would
want to own the company as it's presently structured.""
    Conrac is involved in video displays, computer software,
aircraft instruments, telephone answering machines, welding
equipment and other products.
    ""I'm telling retail clients to sell and leave the rest for
those who can take the risk,"" said Rudolph Hokanson, analyst at
Milwaukee Co.
    He called the 25-dlr offer by Mark IV ""fair value but on
the low side."" ""I don't think management was looking for a
buyer in any way before this offer,"" he said.
    Hokanson said Conrac has conservative finances and has
developed a reputation for quality products that serve niche
markets. He said management has done a good job of turning
around the telephone answering machine business.

<title>CPC &lt;CPC&gt; TO SELL EUROPEAN BUSINESS</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 24 - </dateline>CPC International Inc said it reached
an agreement in principle to sell its European corn wet milling
business to Agricola Finanziaria SpA, a member of the Ferruzzi
Group, for a price in excess of 600 mln dlrs.
    The transaction is expected to be completed by September
30.
    CPC said it expects no material gain or loss this year from
the transaction. But the effect of the deal on 1987 earnings
can be evaluated in full only when the definitive pacts are
completed, it said.
    The long-term effect of the transaction on CPC's earnings
should be positive, it added, as it will allow capital
expenditures to be cut back and will reduce corporate and
divisional overheads as well as operating expenses in the
European business.
    The sale is an important part of a restructuring announced
in November, CPC said.
    Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt incurred
in the purchase of the Arnold Foods and Old London specialty
baking businesses and the stock repurchase program that was 
part of the restructuring.
    As of December 31, CPC had bought about 15 mln of its
common shares, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in January, for a
total cost of 621.8 mln dlrs, according to its 1986 annual
report.
    In December, CPC acquired Arnold Foods and Old London for a
total of about 170 mln dlrs.
    CPC had previously said it wanted to sell the European corn
wet milling business and use the proceeds to help reduce debt,
including that incurred under the share buyback.
    In total, CPC has bought back about 16 mln shares of common
stock, adjusted for the split, it said today. In November it
authorized a buyback of 20 mln shares, adjusted for the split.
    The buyback and the restructuring were triggered in
November, after companies controlled by Ronald Perelman,
chairman of Revlon Group Inc &lt;REV&gt;, acquired about 7.6 pct of
CPC's then outstanding stock.
    In 1986, the European corn wet milling business had sales
of 914.1 mln dlrs, operating income before overheads of 68.8
mln dlrs and associated headquarters overhead costs of 19.7 mln
dlrs, according to CPC's 1986 annual report.
    The businesses' assets were 645.7 mln dlrs in 1986, the

<title>RESORTS INT'L &lt;RT.A&gt; RECEIVES TAKEOVER OFFER</title>
<dateline>    ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., March 24 - </dateline>Resorts International Inc
said it received a proposal from &lt;KSZ Co Inc&gt; under which
holders of Resorts class B stock would receive 140 dlrs a share
in cash and one share of common stock in a new company to be
formed through the takeover.
    Under the offer, Resorts said holders of its class A shares
would receive 15 dlrs a share in cash and three shares of
common stock in the new company.
    Resorts said the offer from KSZ calls for a merger of
Resorts with RI Acquisition Co Inc, a newly formed Delaware
corporation.
    Resorts said that prior to the merger, RI Acquisition would
be capitalized with about 100 mln dlrs of debt and about 220
mln dlrs of equity.
    It said 200 mln dlrs of the equity would be in the form of
special preferred stock.
    The KSZ offer, Resorts said, indicates that KSZ has a
commitment from &lt;M. Davies Cos&gt; to buy all of the special
preferred stock.
    Resorts said the offer will expire at 1700 EST on March 27.
It said it asked its investment advisor, Bear, Stearns and Co,
to advise its board on the offer.
    Earlier this month, the estate of James M. Crosby and
certian members of his family agreed to sell their class B
shares to New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump for 135 dlrs
a share. The estate and family members hold 78 pct of the
752,297 class B shares outstanding.
    Trump also agreed to pay 135 dlrs a share for the remaining
class B shares outstanding.
    Resorts also has about 5,680,000 shares of outstanding
class A stock. These shares carry one one-hundredth the voting
power of the class B shares.
    Trump's offer beat out a rival bid of 135 dlrs a share made
by Pratt Hotel Corp &lt;PRAT&gt;.
    Resorts said that under the proposal made by KSZ, existing
class A and class B shareholders would control about 96 pct of
the outstanding common of the new company formed to acquire
Resorts.
    Resorts said the new company, upon completion of the
merger, would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that the
special preferred stock would immediately be converted into
exchangeable participating preferred of the new company.
    This preferred, Resorts said, would pay a dividend based on
the net cash flows from the new company's Paradise Island
operations.
    A Resorts spokesman said the KSZ offer was made in a
two-page letter and that Resorts could not comment on it
because it did not contain enough information. Resorts has
asked Bear, Sterns to obtain complete data, he said.
    The spokesman said Resorts is not familiar with KSZ but
that it believes the company is controlled by Marvin Davis, the
Denver oilman.
    Calls to Davis were referred to Lee Solters, who handles
public relations for Davis. Solters, said to be travelling, was
not immediately available for comment.

<title>MERGERS, PUBLIC OFFERS SEEN AMONG CAR DEALERS</title>
<author>    By Scott Williams, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    Detroit, March 24 - </dateline>Automobile dealerships have become
large, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1
billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year.
    Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and
buyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that the
largest are considering offering shares to the public, analysts
say.
    Retail car sales ""are at a point of transition. There's not
much that's off the table in terms of creative thinking"" about
ways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the University
of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.
    The retail car market is ""much more freeform now"" than it
was in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroit
analyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates.
    Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different.
Dealerships sold one kind of car--a ""Chevy"" or a Ford or a
Studebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold
738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the National
Automobile Dealers Association.
    That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany's Volkswagen
Beatle--began to gain popularity. The ""Bug"" caused ""a
rebellion"" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from
restrictions placed on them by the major American automakers,
says Jauppi.
    One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has
been in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year,
the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold
increase from 1956--and employed 34 workers.
    ""I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln
dlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money,""
says Cole.
    ""There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that
make cars,"" he says.
    With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying
up other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend
will let up.
    Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D.
Power, a California-based market research firm, says that, by
1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800
principal owners today.
    Many dealers are experimenting with owning several
franchises, some of which might compete against each other. ""It
used to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a
Chevrolet dealer might handle several lines,"" Jauppi says.
    As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about
the possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned
or open international operations.
    Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers,
""are obviously thinking of very seriously,"" says Cole.
    Although some say the franchise system might get in the way
of a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to
trading in car dealer shares.
    ""Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing
the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those
cars. It could happen any time,"" Jauppi says.
    ""If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the
scale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard to
resist taking them public,"" said another analyst.
    And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become
international.
    ""We're going to have international dealers--dealer networks
that are worldwide,"" he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted
particularly to Europe, where the market will expand faster
than the U.S., he says.
    ""It's not totally off the wall,"" says Cole.

<title>FERRUZZI DEAL WITH CPC WORTH 630 MLN DLRS</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, March 25 - </dateline>The Ferruzzi Group's holding company
Agricola Finanziara SpA will pay 630 mln dlrs for the European
corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc under the
agreement reached in principle between the two companies, a
statement by Ferruzzi released by its Brussels office said.
    When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York, it
said only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs.
    Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several
clauses of the contract and needs government authorisations.
    It said the deal would involve 13 starch factories
employing about 5,000 people in eight European Community
countries plus facilities and commercial operations in other EC
states.
    The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of
1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year, or
about one third of EC production, from about 2.7 mln tonnes of
cereals.
    Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend
its presence in the European agro-industrial industry both
geographically and in terms of products.
    It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugar
and of soya oil and cake, and the major cereal trader.
    It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximum
quotas, of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share, and said
it foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch in
the future, notably in the production of ethanol for fuel.
    Raul Gardini, president of the Ferruzzi Group, said the
present management of the CPC milling business will be asked to
remain in their posts.

injunction in the U.K. High Court today to freeze the assets of

whether the court would reach any decision on the request
today. Guinness said last week it planned to take legal action

    Cyclops said the moves followed the announcement earlier

outstanding common stock under an extended tender offer that

    Dixons initially ended its 90.25 dlr a share tender offer

    However, the Securities and Exchange Commission last Friday
pressed Dixons to reopen the offer because the U.K.-based
company had dropped a condition that at least 80 pct of Cyclops
stock be tendered by the close of the offer.
    Dixons then extended the offer until yesterday and earlier
today indicated that a substantial number of tendered Cyclops
shares had been withdrawn, leaving it with only 852,000 shares,
or just over 20 pct of the roughly 4.26 mln Cyclops shares
outstanding.
    Dixons said today that it purchased the tendered shares,
which, when combined with the shares it already holds, gives it

    Cyclops said its reconstituted board includes the three

<title>U.S. SECURITIES GROUP BACKS INSIDER RESTRAINTS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </dateline>The Securities Industry Association
backed a variety of restraints on insider trading and hostile
corporate takeovers and asked Congress to define insider
trading in law.
    The industry trade association called on U.S. securities
firms to take steps to protect sensitive corporate secrets to
guard against illegal trading by employees.
    The association also backed broad federal restrictions on a
variety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers.
    But it said investment banking firms should be allowed to
continue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisition
activities so long as those functions were kept separate.
    The SIA, in a report adopted yesterday by its board of
directors, backed a higher enforcement budget for the federal
Securities and Exchange Commission and called on U.S. stock
exchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages.
    The report said securities firms ""should be more rigorous in
restricting sensitive information on a need-to-know basis.""
    It said firms should train their employees to understand
the need for confidentiality of market-sensitive information.
    It said legislation to define insider trading should avoid
expanding current law in a way that would impede the market.
    It said an insider trading definition should exempt a
securities firm from liability for law violations by its
employees unless the firm had participated in or was aware of
the wrongdoing.
    In the mergers and acquisitions area, the association
advocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeover
protection plans without prior shareholder approval.
    It said a group or individual buying up a company's stock
should be required to file a public disclosure statement before
acquiring more than five pct of the company's shares. Under
current law, disclosure may be made as late as ten days after
exceeding the five pct limit.
    The association said all purchases exceeding 20 pct of a
company's voting stock shouls be made only through a tender
offer open to all shareholders. Under current law there is no
limit on open market purchases.
    The group said the federal government should preempt state
regulation of defensive takeover tactics.
    The group said all tender offers should remain open for at
least 30 calendar days.
    The current requirement is expressed in business days.
    It said so-called ""lockup"" devices, in which securities are
issued to a friendly investor to seal a takeover deal or fend
off an unfriendly predator should be limited to 18.5 pct of the
target company's total common stock.
    Association president Edward O'Brien said the group acted
out of concern over the ad hoc restructuring of corporate
America on Wall Street and investor fears about insider trading
and fairness in the marketplace.

<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 25 - </dateline>Forstmann Little and Co said Lear
Siegler Holding Corp plans to divest its aerospace group
subsidiary, comprised of the Defense Electronics Group and the
Components Group.
    Divestitures had been expected since Lear-Siegler, a
diversified conglomerate, was acquired last December in a 2.1-
billion-dlr-leveraged buyout by the Wall Street firm of
Forstmann Little.
    Lear's aerospace group revenues for fiscal 1987 are
expected to be about 700 mln dlrs, said Forstmann.
    The Defense Electronics Group designs and manufactures
weapons, management systems, flight control systems, remotely
piloted vehicles and reference and navigation systems, mainly
for military markets.
    The Defense Group subsidiaries are Astronics Corp, which is
based in Santa Monica, Calif., and employs 1,076 people;
Instrument and Avionic Systems Corp, based in Grand Rapids,
Mich., and employs 3,479 people; International Corp, based in
Stamford, Conn., and employs 266 people; and Development
Sciences Corp, based in Ontario, Calif., and employs 237
people.
    The Components Group manufactures pumps, bearings, and
other industrial components as well as nuclear control drive
rod mechanisms and valves.
    The Group's subsidiaries include Power Equipment Corp,
based in Cleveland, which employs 880 people; Energy Products
Corp, based in Santa Ana, Calif., which employs 755 people; 
Romek Corp, based in Elyria, Ohio, which employs 262 people;
and Transport Dynamics in Santa Ana, which employs 254 people.
    Overall, Lear's Aerospace Group's eight subsidiaries
employs 7,200 people.
    Lear Siegler said it plans to retain Management Services
Corp, engaged in aircraft maintenance modification for various
Department of Defense agencies.
    Morgan Stanley and Co will act as financial advsiors for

    Last month, Lear Siegler said it planned to sell its Smith

<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 25 - </dateline>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc

Transportation Co from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp &lt;SFX&gt; if
the Interstate Commerce Commission rejects Sante Fe's attempt
to reopen the merger of Southern and the Atchison, Tokepa and
Santa Fe Railway.
    In a filing with the ICC late today, the company outlined
four conditions of its offer to acquire Southern Pacific.
    Among the conditions are that Santa Fe enter into an
agreement to indemnify Kansas City for any contigent liabilites
of Southern Pacific existing as of the closing date, and that
the financial condition of Southern remain largely unchanged
from today onward.
    ""We are willing, even eager, to make a fair market value
offer in cash for the Southern Pacific,"" said Kansas City
Southern president and chief executive officer Landon H.
Rowland.
    ""This offer disproves the constant derogation of the
Sourthern Pacific by SFSP management, best exemplified by SFSP
Chief Executive John Schmidt's comment in ICC hearings that the
Southern Pacific was 'bankrupt,'"" said Rowland.
    He said that merging Southern with Kansas City will achieve
the benefits of an end-to-end merger while preseving the
independece of the Southern Pacific versus its existing prime
competitor, Santa Fe.
    Kansas said that Southern's management had estimated the
value of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to
1.2 billion dlrs.
    It said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon Brothers
Inc, hired in 1983 to advise Southern and Santa Fe in their
merger, appraised Southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and
800 mln dlrs less than Southern's own internal valuations.
    Kanasa City Southern said it will make an offer for
Southern after its books, records and properties are examined.
    ""Once that examination has been completed (and even in the
absence of a willingnes of SFSP to negotiate) KCSI will make an
offer in writing...."" said the company.
    Kansas also said it argued in the ICC filing that Santa Fe
had not met the legal requirements justifying the Commission's
reconsideration of the proposed merger of Santa Fe and Southern
Pacific, two railroads that it said basically parallel each
other throughout their routes.
    ICC voted four to one last summer to reject the merger as
inherently anticompetitive. Kansas said Santa Fe in petitioning
for reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreements
with the Union Pacific, the Denver and Rio Grande Western and
other railroads, adds to the value of the merger.

<title>GENCORP &lt;GY&gt; BID COULD BE RAISED, GROUP SAYS</title>
<author>    BY CAL MANKOWSKI, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 25 - </dateline>An investor group said it might be
willing to raise its 100 dlr per share offer for GenCorp but so
far the company has turned down requests for a meeting.
    ""We might be able to see some additional value if we could
meet"" and get more financial data, said Joel Reed, speaking for
the investor group.
    Reed told Reuters that GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds
""was not interested in sitting down and talking with us at this
time."" Cyril Wagner sought the meeting in a recent telephone
conversation with Reynolds, Reed said.
    Wagner and Brown, along with AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG&gt;,
recently launched a surprise tender offer for GenCorp. The
offer is worth 2.23 billion dlrs.
    Reed said under the circumstances the 100 dlr per share
tender offer, which expires April 15, is a fair offer. GenCorp
gained 3-1/2 to 114 today on the NYSE.
    Reed outlined a plan to reshape GenCorp in the event his
group wins control. He said aerospace, soft drink bottling and
entertainment units are potential divestiture candidates. He
said the tire business, which the group wants to keep, may be
more viable if merged with another tire company.
    ""One option would be to try to grow the tire business
through combination or an acquisition,"" Reed said. He said he
believes such a merger could create a stronger force in the
tire industry.
    Gary Miller, chief financial officer of AFG, said his
company has a record of acquiring mature businesses and
boosting productivity. Automation and incentives tied to profit
sharing have been used with success, he said.
    In the case of GenCorp's RKO General broadcasting stations,
Reed said the plan of the partners is to step into GenCorp's
shoes and proceed with plans to  sell the stations.
    The partners said if they succed in acquiring GenCorp they
intend to consummate sale of WOR-TV in New York to MCA Inc
&lt;MCA&gt;. GenCorp last year entered into an agreement to sell the
station for 387 mln dlrs.
    The partners also said if they acquire Gencorp they would
also proceed with the proposed sale of KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to
Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS&gt;. RKO General would receive 217 mln dlrs
and Fidelilty Television, which challenged the license, would
get about 103 mln dlrs.
    The partners also said the Federal Communications
Commission established an expedited schedule for receiving
comments on their request for special temporary authorization
of proposed trust arrangements while the FCC considers a formal
application for transfer of the broadcast unit.
    Reed said he was pleased with the expedited schedule
because it provides time for the agency to act on the request
before the expiration of the tender offer.
    He said it was the aim of the partners to move as quickly
as possible to eliminate uncertainty surrounding the stations.
    Asked about criticism of the takeover attempt voiced by
some municipal officials in Akron, Ohio, where GenCorp is
headquartered, Reed said, ""the plan of the partners offers long
term growth for Ohio.""
    He noted that the aerospace business, slated for
divestiture under the partners' plan, is located in California.
""Our program is one that overall would provide the greatest
long term growth for all segments,"" he said.

<title>BP TO OFFER 7.4 BILLION DLRS FOR STANDARD SHARES</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 26 - </dateline>British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L&gt; said it
intended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil
Co &lt;SRD.N&gt; it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, for
a total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted.
    The offer would be made through its &lt;BP North America Inc&gt;
unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. The
offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares
being tendered.
    BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based
on its own valuation as well as those of its financial
advisers. It took into account reviews of both public and
non-public information.
    Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down
1-3/4 dlrs.
    BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at
last night's close.
    About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP's
own resources.
    The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly from
banks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and
partly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. The
company said it was in the course of arranging these
facilities.
    BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group's
investment in Standard was its largest single asset. Full
ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be
made without the limitations of a minority interest.
    BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum
use of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices
were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the
investment.
    Walters added that it also felt that, due to management
changes in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even
in a lower oil price environment.
    Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs
and in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before
tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.
    Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.
One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group
should spend so much money buying a company it already
controlled.
    BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard
shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.
    It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on
the U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended to
dispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the
1987/88 financial year, analysts said.
    Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted
that any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would
depend on the reaction of the markets.
    The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59
pct from 20 pct currently, he said.
    However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not
repeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standard
returning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from
its cash flow -- were good.
    Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.
    Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to
make money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from
production and its downstream activities would push it
comfortably into surplus.
    BP initially took a stake in Standard following the
discovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had
inadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,
which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude
oil.
    The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management
reorganisation of Standard in the past year.
    The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was
now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the
tender offer, Spedding said.
    BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as major
balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well
received in the markets.
    The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially
after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division
-- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come
straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by
other sectors.

<title>BP UNITS SEEK FIVE BILLION DLR REVOLVING CREDIT</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 26 - </dateline>BP International and BP North America
are seeking a five billion dlr, four year syndicated credit
facility in support of British Petroleum Co Plc's tender offer
for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co it does not already own,
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York said as arranger.
    The facility, to be guaranteed by British Petroleum Co Plc
&lt;BP.L&gt; is probably the largest credit facility ever arranged in
Europe, bond analysts said. Full terms will be announced either
later today or tomorrow morning. BP said earlier it planned a
tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own
for 70 dlrs a share cash.
    The financing being arranged by Morgan Guaranty will take
the form of a fully committed revolving credit. As announced
earlier, BP also is arranging a U.S. Commercial paper program
in connection with the tender and part of the revolver will be
used to support that program.
    The exact size of the U.S. Program has not been decided and
the dealers have not yet been chosen.
    The credit facility will also allow the borrower to issue
cash advances with maturities of one, three or six months
through a tender panel, which will be comprised of banks
committed to the facility.
    Despite the unprecedented size of this euromarket facility,
Morgan Guaranty said that it was being syndicated only among
BP's relationship banks.
    As a result, banks were being offered lead manager status
at 200 mln dlrs, co-lead management at 125 mln and manager at
75 mln.
    Although pricing on many credit facilities has become
extremely fine in recent years because of the keen competition
to win mandates, Morgan Guaranty said banks would be
compensated fairly since this is a special purpose facility
which must be completed quickly, with signing expected in about
10 days.

<title>FOREIGN FIRMS HOPE TO JOIN JAPAN TELECOM COMPANY</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 26 - </dateline>One of two rival firms seeking to enter
Japan's international telecommunications market said it will
offer a stake in the company to 10 foreign firms.
    President of &lt;International Telecom Japan Inc&gt; (ITJ), Nobuo
Ito, decline to specify what share the firms would take, but
told Reuters they would not participate in its management.
    ITJ and &lt;International Digital Communications Planning Inc&gt;

Pacific Telesis Group &lt;PAC.N&gt; own 20 pct stakes, are set to
merge into a new entity to compete against &lt;Kokusai Denshin
Denwa Co Ltd&gt; (KDD).
    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has urged the
two rival firms to merge so KDD would have only a single
competitor. The ministry has also rejected foreign management.
    Japan's law limits foreign ownership of any new
international telecommunications entrant to 33 pct, so C and
W's and Pacific's stakes could be three pct in the merged firm,
sources said. Those seeking to join are General Electric Co
&lt;GE.N&gt;, Ford Motor Co &lt;F.N&gt;, &lt;Citibank NA&gt;, BankAmerica Corp
&lt;BAC.NYSE&gt;, &lt;Shearson Lehman Bros Inc&gt;, &lt;Saloman Brothers&gt;,
&lt;Asia Boeing Computer Service&gt;, Unisys Corp &lt;UIS.N&gt;, &lt;Societe
Generale&gt; and Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.FRA&gt;.
    The merger plan has been criticised for excluding foreign
firms from a meaningful position in the market.
    The U.K.'s Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, U.S. Secretary
of State George Shultz, U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have all

<title>SIEMENS REBUTTS U.S. CRITICISM ON CGCT OFFER</title>

Criticism it is blocking American Telephone and Telegraph
Corp's &lt;T.N&gt;, AT and T, entry into French telecommunications
firm &lt;Compagnie Generale Constructions Telephoniques&gt;, CGCT.
    Management board member Hans Baur told journalists that the
acquisition of a joint 20 pct stake in CGCT by AT and T and
Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken NV &lt;PGLO.AS&gt; had not been decided
on two years ago as claimed by AT and T.
    The French government, which owns CGCT, had asked Siemens
at the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT.
The result of the negotiations was still open.
    Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer.
    The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairman
James E. Olson as saying that Siemens' attempt to stop AT and T
and Philips could lead to a resurgence of protectionism in the
U.S.
    Baur said he expected the French government to decide on
the winning bid by the end of April. CGCT's share of the French
switchboard market amounts to around 16 pct.
    The French government has limited CGCT participation by
foreign companies to 20 pct and set a price of 500 mln francs
for the whole company.
    Bauer said the 20 pct limitation would only apply to the
initial stake. He did not rule out a stake increase later but
said Siemens' aim was to introduce its technology.
    Bauer said Siemens and French telecommunications firm
&lt;Jeumont-Schneider SA&gt; submitted a joint offer at the start of
March because of the 20 pct limitation. Both companies will
form a joint venture to take over the whole of CGCT.
   Siemens will have a 20 pct stake in the new company while
Jeumont-Schneider will own 80 pct. Apart from investing 100 mln
francs for the modernisation of CGCT, a new research centre

<title>FIRST INTERSTATE SEEKS ACQUISITION</title>
<author>    by Janie Gabbett</author>
<dateline>    LOS ANGELES, March 26 - </dateline>Less than two months after First
Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica
Corp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy,
but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought.
    In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he's looking for
ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991,
""so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our
independence, if possible.""
    In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major
East Coast banks to buy banks in California.
    First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, and
the nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western
states and has franchise operations in four additional states.
    Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for
large U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the 
lucrative California market and the West Coast region.
    While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when
asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied,
""That's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive
not to think that.""
    Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as
""opportunistic"".
    He said he will look for banks in management trouble that
he can get at a bargain, then add management to restore
profitability, or for banks in states where First Interstate
already operates, then cut costs by combining resources.
    The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said most
of the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased
at a discount because of the depressed regional economy.
    Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move
him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, ""We
continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of
people continue to monitor and look at us.""
    Banking analysts, however, consider another First
Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happen
any time soon.
    Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25
billion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank, ""a very,
very difficult decision.""
    With that decision made, however, he acknowledged First
Interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number
four position in the California banking community.
    ""The competition in this state is tough,"" he said, noting
CityBank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branches
from Sears Roebuck company. ""CityBank is moving rapidly to move
us down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth,"" he said.
    Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that Security
Pacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona,
Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regional
competitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated.
    ""Security is, has been and continues to be a highly
profitable and obviously well managed company,"" he said.
    He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has the
advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer
and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional
banks a common name.
    Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good
financial condition, First Interstate continues to sustain
serious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy,
real estate and agriculture dominate the economy.
    Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked,
he said, ""I don't think it has bottomed out, because I think
most of the problems are real estate-related and the real
estate problems are going to be with us for several years.""
    Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in
the Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate's
franchise operation.
    First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First
Interstate financial services in ten states.
    While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise
operation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said because
most of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion into
the Midwest must come first.
    Calling the franchise system, ""moderately profitable,""
Pinola said, ""It is going to take a rejuvenation of the
agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed
we were generating before the last year or two.""
    On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks
1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks
with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.

<title>FED'S HELLER URGES BROAD REFORM TO AID BANKING</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </dateline>Federal Reserve Board Governor
Robert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened by
permitting formation of financial services holding companies
involved in areas like banking, insurance, real estate and
securities.
    In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bank
and Financial Analysts' Association, Heller said, ""I believe
that increased diversification along geographic and product
lines is the key to strengthening the American banking system.""
    He said he supported the idea of financial services holding
companies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding
Companies in which regulation of various bank, thrift,
insurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiaries
would be handled on functional lines.
    ""Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the
bank to the associated institutions, and all transactions would
have to be on an arms-length basis,"" Heller said.
    Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks'
special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries.
    Heller said he ""would require the holding company to serve
as a 'source of strength' to the bank by making a commitment to
maintain the bank's capital.
    ""In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail as
long as the holding company has a positive net worth.""
    Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted
to own a financial services holding company, again with the
provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise
if necessary.
    Heller said the effects of these actions ""would be banks
that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them"" in
which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to
""loot the bank"" was removed.
    Such diversification would give access to national and
international financial services to corporations across the
United States.
    Heller said that would mean ""the steady decline of America's
banks in the world financial league tables would be arrested"" by
permitting them to become more competitive.

<title>BP &lt;BP&gt; DOES NOT PLAN TO HIKE STANDARD &lt;SRD&gt; BID</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </dateline>British Petroleum Co Plc does not
intend to raise the price of its planned 70 dlr per share offer
for the publicly held 45 pct of Standard Oil Co, BP Managing
Director David Simon said.
    ""We don't seen this as any progressive bidding game,"" he
told reporters at a news conference. BP now owns 55 pct of
Standard's stock.
    Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its
planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst, whom he would not
identify, as saying BP's careful evaluation means the company
is not going to raise its offer.
    ""I think that (an increase) would be totally wrong. I think
the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate
about ligigation,"" he said. ""Let's wait and see how the offer
runs.""
    Another official declined to speculate under what
circumstances BP might raise its bid.
    The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7.2 times
Standard's 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent
evaluation of the company's assets, including the value of its
oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves.
    He said the price Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD&gt; &lt;SC&gt; paid
for publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 5.1 times
cash flow.
    The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct
premium over Standard's stock price over the past year.
    BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to as
much as two-third's of the 7.4 billion dlrs BP needs for its
offer will come from existing sources. The rest will be
financed by new debt.
    BP will draw in cash from its operating companies around
the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of
credit, he explained.
    The company's debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12
percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is
completed, Chase said. But the ratio will be back below 40 pct
within 12 months, he added.
    Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil's publicly
held shares are held by financial institutions.
    Simon said Standard's board was informed of the offer on
March nine and has been considering it since that time.
    He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that
would delay completion of the acquisition. ""We have informed
Washington of our intentions and we've already been an integral
part of ownership of U.S. oil reserves,"" he pointed out.
    Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil
prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained, and that
the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in
Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production.
    ""We think there are signals that current conditions are
more favorable than they have been for sometime,"" Simon said.
    ""We have hopes for greater stability, but we do not see
prices going much higher,"" he added.

<title>USX &lt;X&gt; SAYS TALKS ENDED WITH BRITISH PETROLEUM</title>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, March 26 - </dateline>USX Corp chairman David Roderick said
the company had ended talks with British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP&gt;
about the possible sale of some energy assets and said USX has
no immediate restructuring plans for its oil businesses.
    ""We have terminated our discussions,"" Roderick told Reuters
after a speech to the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association
here. He said USX was not conducting talks with any other
possible buyer of its energy assets.
    Earlier today, BP said it planned to offer 70 dlrs per
share for the Standard Oil Co's &lt;SRD&gt; publicly held stock.
    USX said in December the company had held formal
discussions with BP about the potential sale of some of its
overseas oil assets and USX had received expressions of
interest from a half dozen other oil companies.
    Roderick, in response to a question, said USX had no
immediate plans to restructure its Marathon Oil Co, or Texas
Oil and Gas Corp. He said USX also did not plan to sell any of
its 49 pct interest in the giant Yates Field in west Texas.
    ""We want to maintain our production in the Yates Field
during these difficult times,"" Roderick added.
    In response to a question, Roderick also said he did not
know whether Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court was
accumulating USX stock. In recent days, traders have suggested
Holmes a Court was buying additional shares.
    Roderick said Carl Ichan, who terminated an eight billion
dlr hostile takeover plan for USX in January, continued to hold
a sizable interest in the company. ""Mr. Ichan still apparently
has 11.4 pct. He hasn't bought any more stock or sold any,""
Roderick said. ""He's a very satisfied shareholder right now. I
talk with him monthly.""
    In his speech, Roderick predicted the fall in the value of
the dollar would set the stage for the U.S. to solve its trade
deficit problem which totaled 170 billion dlrs in 1986.
    ""I expect by the early 1990s the U.S. will be running a net
trade surplus,"" Roderick said. ""I think the worst is over and
we can look forward to stability and upward movement ahead.""
    However, the USX chairman warned that European trading
partners may resist the turn in the U.S. trade deficit. ""Some
economic discomfort must be transferred from the United States
to our friends, trading partners and allies.""

<title>BP &lt;BP&gt; MAY HAVE TO RAISE BID -  ANALYSTS</title>
<author>    By STEVEN RADWELL, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </dateline>British Petroleum Co PLC may have to
raise its planned 70 dlrs a share tender offer for the publicly
traded shares of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD&gt;, analysts said.
    ""There's a lot of speculation here that someway or other
they would be forced to come up with another bid,"" said Rosario
Ilaqua of L.F. Rothschild.
    And despite BP managing director David Simon's denial today
that BP would raise the offer, the analysts said that remained
a distinct possibility.
    Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch/Shell
Group's &lt;RD&gt; &lt;SC&gt; bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil
Co in 1984 and 1985. Royal Dutch/Shell eventually raised its
initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share, after
lawsuits by minority shareholders.
    ""I think they're going to have to go a little higher
eventually, just as Royal Dutch/Shell had to go a little higher
for the Shell Oil minority shares,"" Bruce Lazier of Prescott
Ball and Turben said. He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share.
    Royal Dutch/Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30.5 pct
of Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984. After
objections from minority shareholders about the price, Royal
Dutch/Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender
offer in April 1984.
    But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the
offer. After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil,
Royal Dutch/Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase.
    It ended up paying 5.67 billion dlrs for the outstanding
Shell Oil stake, a significant premium to its original bid of
about 5.2 billion dlrs.
    The analysts made their comments before Simon's remarks at
a BP press conference in New York this afternoon.
    Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told
clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible. The
analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share.
    Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the
Royal Dutch/Shell group precedent. But there may be shareholder
lawsuits for the same reason, they said.
    Goldman Sachs and Co, BP's investment advisor, advised the
Shell Oil board in 1984 and 1985.

<title>STANDARD OIL &lt;SRD&gt; SEES BOOST IN 1987 CASH FLOW</title>
<dateline>    CLEVELAND, March 26 - </dateline>Standard Oil Co expects the sale of
assets and federal tax refunds resulting from last year's loss
to add about one billion dlrs to its normal cash flows from
operations in 1987, its annual report said.
    Last year, the report noted, the cash flow from operations
dropped to 1.8 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion dlrs in 1985 and
3.2 billion dlrs in 1984 due principally to lower oil prices.
    The report, prepared before British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP&gt;
disclosed plans to seek the rest of Standard's stock, put 1987
capital spending at 1.6 billion dlrs, down from the 1.7 billion
dlrs projected in January.
    Standard's capital spending totaled 1.77 billion dlrs in
1986.
    The report showed a decline in proven oil reserves to 2.41
billion barrels at the end of 1986 from 2.65 billion barrels a
year earlier as discoveries and other additions dropped to 11.4
mln barrels last year from 23.2 mln in 1985.
    But it said gas reeserves rose to 7.31 trillion cubic feet
from 7.22 trillion at the end of 1985 despite a 30.9 mln cubic
feet downward revision in previous reserve estimates during
1986. Discoveries and other additions totaled 200.5 billion
cubic feet last year, up from 175.9 billion in 1985, it added.
    Standard said both oil and gas production increased last
year -- to 726,600 barrels per day from 719,700 barrels the
previous day and to 154.4 mln cubic feet daily from 10.1 mln in
1985.
    But the average sales price of both dropped -- to 13.83
dlrs per barrel from 26.43 dlrs for oil in 1985 and to 1.49
dlrs per thousand cubic feet from 2.18 dlrs a year earlier.

<title>JAPAN ACTS TO COOL U.S. ANGER ON TELECOMS DISPUTE</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 27 - </dateline>Japan has sought to assure the U.S. It is
not trying to keep foreign equity in a new Japanese
international telecommunications company below the legal limit
of 33 pct, a Post and Telecommunications ministry official
said.
    In a letter sent yesterday, Postal Minister Shunjiro
Karasawa told U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that the
ministry does not object to foreign participation by those U.S.
Firms that have expressed interest.
    But it does oppose any foreign international
telecommunications carrier having a management role, he said.
    The move appears to be an effort to dampen U.S. Opposition
to the planned merger of two rival firms seeking to compete
with the current monopoly &lt;Kokusai Denwa Denshin Co Ltd&gt;, and
to reduce the share held in any KDD rival by U.K.'s Cable and
Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L&gt;, industry analysts and diplomats said.
    One of the rival firms, &lt;International Telecom Japan Inc&gt;
(ITJ) has offered a stake in the company to eight U.S. Firms
including General Electric Co &lt;GE&gt;, Ford Motor Co &lt;F&gt; and
Citibank NA &lt;CCI), and two European companies, ITJ president
Nobuo Ito said yesterday.
    Cable and Wireless holds a 20 pct share in a second
potential KDD rival, &lt;International Digital Communications
Planning Inc&gt;, along with &lt;C Itoh and Co&gt;. Merrill Lynch and Co
Inc &lt;MER&gt; and Pacific Telesis International Inc &lt;PAC&gt;, both of
the U.S., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively.
    The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the
merger of the two firms because it says the market can only
support a single KDD competitor.
    It has also rejected management participation by an
international common carrier, such as Cable and Wireless,
arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists.
    Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy, Jonathan
Solomon, yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a
merger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless' share to
less than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20
pct, the ministry official said.
    Channeling the U.S. Firms into a single merged competitor
would most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless'
share, industry analysts said.
    ""Eventually the ministry will get what it wants -- one
combined competitor,"" Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd analyst
Darrell Whitten said.
    ""Political ... Leverage may get the total foreign share up
to a certain amount, but you won't find any one company with an
extraordinarily large holding,"" Whitten said.
    Western diplomatic sources were more blunt.
    ""They (the ministry) don't want to see Cable and Wireless
with a reasonable share and they think of all sorts of
strategies to reduce that share,"" one said.
    Fumio Watanabe, a senior Keidanren (a leading business
organization) official who has been trying to arrange the
merger, will present a new outline of his proposal on Thursday,
the ministry official said.

<title>BRIERLEY BIDS 4.35 DOLLARS/SHARE FOR PROGRESSIVE</title>

launched a full takeover bid for the supermarket group
&lt;Progressive Enterprises Ltd&gt; at 4.35 dlrs a share.
    BIL said in a statement the offer is conditional on minimum
acceptances totalling 30 mln shares, just under 25 pct of the
120.4 mln Progressive shares on issue.
    Progressive is currently involved in a proposed merger with
&lt;Rainbow Corp Ltd&gt;. Rainbow earlier this week raised its stake
in Progressive to 52 pct. BIL opposes the Rainbow merger and
analysts say BIL needs a 25 pct stake in Progressive to prevent
it occurring.
    The merger involves shareholders in Progressive and Rainbow
both receiving shares in a new company &lt;Astral Pacific Corp
Ltd&gt; on a one-for-one exchange basis.
    The BIL bid is higher than the 4.20 dlrs BIL said it would
offer when it first announced on Monday it would make a full
bid for Progressive, and it follows much public debate between
BIL and Rainbow.
    BIL Chief Executive Paul Collins said last week that he
opposes the Rainbow/Progressive merger because BIL sees
Progressive shares as being worth twice as much as Rainbow's.
BIL has not disclosed how many Progressive shares it holds.
    Rainbow has said the merger is soundly based. Chairman
Allan Hawkins said last week that BIL's actions were aimed only
at dirsrupting the merger and were not in the interests of
Progressive shareholders.
    Both Rainbow's and Progressive's boards have approved the
merger proposal. It has also been approved by the Commerce
Commission, but BIL's bid is still subject to the Commission's
scrutiny.
    Progressive shares ended at 4.35 dlrs, Rainbow at 3.42 and
BIL at 4.17 at the close of New Zealand Stock Exchange trading

cash.

short-term debt incurred last December when the company
purchased the Sperry Aerospace Group.

42.5 pct owned by Honeywell Inc, 42.5 pct by Bull and 15 pct by
NEC, the new company said.
    Honeywell added that terms of the agreement with NEC and
Bull allow it to reduce its current 42.5 pct stake in the new
company to 19.9 pct at the end of 1988 by selling just over
half its shares to Bull. Book value at the time will determine

controls for buildings, industry, aerospace and defense,
Honeywell is now focusing its management, technical and

customer, purchasing computers for its own internal data
processing, for integration into Honeywell buidling and
industrial automation systems and for resale to the U.S.
governement.

international consortia are battling for the right to buy it.
    West Germany's Siemens AG &lt;SIEG.F&gt; has teamed up with the
French group Jeumont-Schneider, in opposition to a bid from the
U.S. Group ATT &lt;T.N&gt; and the Dutch Philips Telecommunications
BV &lt;PGLO.AS&gt; in association with the French telecommunications

GenCorp Inc said it would move to unseat the board of directors

    General Acquisition Co, a partnership of Wagner and Brown

<dateline>    DUESSELDORF, March 30 - </dateline>Mannesmann AG &lt;MMWG.F&gt; said it has
reached a series of agreements giving it an indirect majority
stake in the &lt;Fichtel und Sachs AG&gt; car parts group.
    The takeover is contingent on approval from the Federal
Cartel Office in West Berlin, a spokesman said, adding that
Mannesmann was confident the authorities would not block the
purchase.
    Mannesmann is buying 75 pct of &lt;MEC Sachs
Vermoegensholding&gt; which owns 37.5 pct of Sachs AG, which in
turn holds 96.5 pct of Fichtel und Sachs. The MEC shares will
be bought from the granddaughters of the firm's founder.
    Mannesmann is also purchasing a 25.01 pct stake in Fichtel
und Sachs from Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F&gt; and has an option to buy
the bank's remaining 10 pct stake, a company statement said.
    In addition to these firm agreements, Mannesmann is also
talking with the state-owned steel group Salzgitter AG
 &lt;SALG.H&gt; on buying its 24.98 pct stake in Fichtel und Sachs.
 This would give Mannesmann around 75 pct of Fichtel und Sachs.
    Salzgitter said it decided to give up its own original
plans to seek a majority stake in Sachs after holding talks
with the government in Bonn.
    Earlier this month Mannesmann disclosed that it might want
a majority stake in Sachs after previously saying it was
seeking to buy only a minority holding in the company, which
has annual turnover of 2.2 billion marks and employs 17,000.
    The acquisition is part of Mannesmann's efforts to
diversify into high-technology areas and away from its previous
reliance on steel and pipe-making. More

the anti-cartel authorities would probably rule on the takeover
in the new few weeks.

initial takeover offer for CPC's European corn wet milling

    The offer was raised on March 24 to a final 675 mln dlrs in
cash after CPC told Amylum its initial bid was below Ferruzzi's
630 mln stg offer, Callebaut said.
    On the same day, CPC announced it had agreed in principle
to sell its European business to Ferruzzi in a 630 mln dlr
deal.
    Noting that Ferruzzi was studying a public offering of
shares in its unit &lt;European Sugar (France)&gt; to fund the CPC

<author>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    New York, March 30 - </dateline>The Bass Group, once thought by
analysts to be eager to sell its holdings in Taft Broadcasting
Co, emerged as another potential bidder for the Ohio
broadcasting company.
    The Bass Group, which holds 24.9 pct of Taft, said it had
talked with other taft stockholders and some company managers
and directors ""concerning participation in a group to acquire
control"" of the company.
    The Bass group said it had talks with other Taft
stockholders and members of Taft management about participating
in a group to acquire control. The group, which is led by the
wealthy bass brothers of Fort Worth, Texas, did not identify
any of the other people with whom it had talks.
    Taft said Friday it would negotiate with its vice Chairman
Dudley Taft on his group's 150 dlr per share or 1.38 billion
dlr offer for the company.
    At the time, the company said it authorized its adviser,
Goldman, Sachs and Co, to explore other takeover proposals and
to supply financial data to other interested bidders.
    ""If indeed, the reason Dudley Taft is no longer president
is because the bass group tossed him out, I couldn't see them
backing him on any deal,"" said one analyst, who asked not to be
identified.
    ""I think they wanted a way out. Now, this sounds like
they're going to join the group and buy themselves out,"" said

    Analysts have speculated that Carl Lindner may be
interested in acquiring the company. they speculated he may be
one of the shareholders in talks with the bass group.
    Lindner, chairman of American Financial Corp, holds 16.2
pct of Taft. He was not immediately available for comment.
    Analysts have said they are baffled by the strength of
Taft's stock price compared to what they see as breakup values

of 160 to 165 dlrs per share.

<title>U.S. DOT APPROVES AMERICAN &lt;AMR&gt;-ACI &lt;ACF&gt; PACT</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 30 - </dateline>The U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT) said it gave final clearance to the
proposed 225 mln dlr acquisition of AirCal Inc by American
Airlines Inc.
    ""The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen
competition or to be inconsistent with the public interest,"" the
DOT said in a statement.
    AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is a
unit of AMR Corp.
    The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger plan
Feb. 20.
    American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms of
revenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively small
carrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is the
nation's 17th largest passenger carrier. Their merger would not
alter American's third-place ranking, according to data
compiled by Aviation Daily, a leading industry trade magazine.
    The combination would incrase American's share of the U.S.
market to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct, the DOT said.
    The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantially
reduce competition on the four routes on which both carriers
provide either nonstop or single-plane service.
    At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers, the DOT
said it found no evidence that other carriers could not
increase or begin service that competed with a merged
American-AirCal.
    Concerning the 14th, ""While entry may not be possible at the
Orange County Airport in the near future, DOT found that the
service provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area,
especially at the Los Angeles International Airport, will
provide effective competition for Orange County travelers in
long-haul markets,"" the DOT said.
    The merger would give American control of 37 pct of the
authorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange County
terminal, where environmental concerns and a small terminal
building limit future opportunities for expansion.
    The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed comments
opposing the merger but ""raised no new facts or arguments.""
    Under the merger terms, announced Nov. 17, American will
pay 15 dlrs a share for the outstanding stock of ACI Holdings.

<title>GENCORP &lt;GY&gt; REJECTS UNSOLICITED TAKEOVER BID</title>
<dateline>    AKRON, OHio, March 30 - </dateline>Gencorp Inc said its board urged
shareholders to reject the hostile unsolicited 100 dlr a share
tender offer made March 18 by General Acquisition Inc, an
affiliate of Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries INc.
    Gencorp also said it is developing a financially superior
alternative that would enable shareholders to benefit from the
full value of the company.
    In a letter to shareholders, Chairman A. William Reynolds 
said the offer is a ""highly conditional, contingently financed
bust-up offer"" that seeks to deny shareholders the true value
of their investment in Gencorp.
    Reynolds said the board reached its decision to reject the
offer after careful study with legal and financial advisers. He
said the board has authorized management to explore
alternatives aimed at providing shareholders with a
""financially superior"" alternative to the general acquisition
offer.
    A Gencorp spokesman, in response to questions, would not
comment on market speculation that the company's management may
develop a leveraged buyout offer of its own. He would also not
comment on when a better alternative might be developed.
    Gencorp's stock has traded well above the 100 dlr offer
price since the tender was made. Today, Gencorp closed at
114-1/4, up 1-5/8.
    Reynolds said in the letter that for the last few years,
Gencorp management has taken action to enhance shareholder
value, and the stock price and earnings have improved since he
joined the company.
    Gencorp said the partnership's offer is a ""bargain price""
acquisition that was ""using financing from a syndicate of banks
that does not yet exist and a bridge loan from Shearson Lehman
brothers that shearson is not obligated to provide.""
    Reynolds also said the offer would result in a radical
alteration and selloff of Gencorp's assets, including Aerojet
General to refinance General Acquisition's borrowings with the
profits going to Wagner and Brown and AFG instead of
shareholders.
    The letter also said the General Acquisition offer
""jeopardizes the security and interests"" of its shareholders,
employees, customers, suppliers and the communities throughout
the country where the company's facilities are located.

questioned how the company might give better value to
shareholders.
    Gencorp earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr per

   The partnership called the response inflammatory and

     The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would
provide a ""superior value yet they continue their attempt to

pill."" Poison pills are shareholder rights plan that make
takeovers more expensive.
    Gencorp said in its statement earlier that the date its

to April six from April three. It said the extension was
subject to further extensions by the board and is conditioned

<title>CSR SELLING DELHI TO EXXON UNIT, DROPS DELHI FLOAT</title>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, March 31 - </dateline>CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S&gt; and Exxon Corp &lt;XON&gt;
unit &lt;Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc&gt; said CSR
has agreed to sell its &lt;Delhi Australia Fund&gt; (DAF) to Esso for
985 mln Australian dlrs.
    The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a joint
statement.
    The previously announced float of part of its Delhi
interest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement.
    Delhi Australia Fund owns &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd&gt;, which
holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S&gt;-led
Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects.
    In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally
in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate
prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi's
interests in the next two years, the statement said.
    ""The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will
be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the
float,"" CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement.
    Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus
efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building
materials in which CSR has had long and successful management
experience and strong market leadership.
    With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses
more aggressively and earlier, he said.
    As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi
sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of &lt;Pioneer
Sugar Mills Ltd&gt; that it does not already hold, valuing its
entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs.
    After Bass Strait, the onshore Cooper and Eromanga Basin is
Australia's largest oil and gas producing area with current
gross oil production of 45,000 barrels per day (BDP), gas
liquids output of 30,000 BPD and gas sales of 480 mln cubic
feet a day, the CSR-Esso statement said.
    The purchase gives Esso, a 50/50 partner with The Broken
Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S&gt; in the Bass Strait, its first onshore
production in Australia, they said.
    Esso's chairman Stuart McGill said he hoped Esso can assist
in maintaining the high rate of oil and gas discoveries in the
Cooper-Eromanga area.
    ""These discoveries will help Australia's self-sufficiency in
oil reserves thereby offsetting in part the decline in Bass
Strait production now under way,"" McGill said.
    In a separately released letter to CSR shareholders, Kelman
said CSR was within days of completing plans for the float of
CSR Petroleum when it received an offer from Esso.
    He said CSR is convinced the sale was the correct decision
in view of the risks associated with the oil business.
    The price-sharing arrangement provides for CSR to share
equally with Esso in higher returns if oil prices average more
than 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years, he said.
    Kelman said a revaluation of CSR's investment in Delhi to
net realisable value as of today, CSR's annual balance-date,
will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs.
    However, revaluations and profits on sales of other assets
will significantly reduce this loss, he said.
    He also said that CSR is sufficiently encouraged by future
prospects and the opportunity to reposition the group in core
businesses to foreshadow an increase in final dividend payable
in July to 10 cents from nine to make an annual 19 cents
against 18 in 1985/86.

<title>ANALYSTS APPLAUD CSR'S BOLD MOVE TO SELL DELHI</title>
<author>    By Peter Bale, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, March 31 - </dateline>CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S&gt; has made a bold move in
selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and
ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share
analysts said.
    ""It sounds like a good deal,"" Stuart McKibbin of &lt;A.C. Goode
and Co&gt; told Reuters.
    CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas
interests held in the &lt;Delhi Australia Fund&gt; and would instead
sell it to Exxon Corp &lt;XON&gt; unit &lt;Esso Exploration and
Production Australia Inc&gt; for 985 mln dlrs.
    In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest
sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it
does not already hold in &lt;Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd&gt;.
    ""This will be a big shock to the market, which was under the
impression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi,""
McKibbin said.
    A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and
300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, CSR had given
itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on
an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing
divisions of sugar and building products, analysts said.
    CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right
to share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an
oil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years.
    Delhi is one of Australia's largest onshore oil producers
yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin.
Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs
for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs.
    Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker &lt;Bain and Co Ltd&gt;
said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry
was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of
Australian-owned assets to a foreign company.
    ""The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold
back to the Americans,"" Goldston-Morris said.
    The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the
largest player in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry
and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties
and mills in the country, analysts said.
    They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend
acceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the
bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices.
    Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next
season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said.
    Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging
investment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company's
overall performance, analysts said.
    CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on
what had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirely
from U.S. Dollar debt, they said.
    ""It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirely
with debt, the currency collapsed on them and then the oil
price collapsed on them,"" Owen Evans of Sydney broker &lt;Meares
and Philips Ltd&gt; said.
    Esso not only picked up Delhi's oil and gas output but also
gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses
accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions.
    Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake
in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50
Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd
&lt;BRKN.S&gt;.
    ""Esso has been very keen to diversify from the Gippsland
Basin. They haven't found too much oil in Bass Strait lately
and Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production,""
Goldston-Morris said.

<dateline>    SYDNEY, March 31 - </dateline>CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S&gt; said it will offer 2.20
dlrs cash each for the shares it does not already hold in
&lt;Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd&gt;.
    CSR already holds 31.74 pct of Pioneer's 99.80 mln issued
shares, it said in a statement.
    The offer price values the entire Pioneer Sugar share
capital at 219.6 mln dlrs and compares with today's closing
market level of 1.85 dlrs a share.
    CSR said it will announce further details of the offer
soon, including an alternative offer of CSR shares for Pioneer
Sugar stock.
    It said the offer is generous since it will give Pioneer
Sugar shareholders a price equivalent to 29 times Pioneer's net
earnings last financial year and a premium of 22 pct over
yesterday's market price which CSR said it believed already
contained an element of takeover speculation.
    It also gives a premium of 91 pct over Pioneer's last
reported net tangible assets per share, CSR said.
    CSR said the generous offer price reflects the cost savings
which will flow from integrated management of CSR's and
Pioneer's raw sugar mills and building materials businesses.
    These economies can only be achieved through CSR control
and management of Pioneer Sugar, it added.
    The takeover announcement came soon after CSR's earlier
reported statement that it will sell its &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty

"<text>
<title>FERRUZZI MAY FLOAT UP TO 49 PCT OF PARIS UNIT</title>
<dateline>    RAVENNA, Italy, March 31 - </dateline>&lt;Gruppo Ferruzzi&gt; is studying a
project which could result in a public share offer of up to 49
pct of its French unit &lt;European Sugar (France)&gt; and could
raise around 400 mln dlrs, Ferruzzi chairman Raul Gardini said.
    Gardini told Reuters the operation under consideration was
aimed at ""international markets"" and that the figure of 400 mln
dlrs given in some press reports ""was probably about right.""
    European Sugar, wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit Eridania
Zuccherifici Nazionali SpA &lt;ERDI.M&gt;, is expected to absorb the
European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc
&lt;CPC.N&gt; which Ferruzzi recently agreed to buy.
    Ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle to
buy the CPC operation for 630 mln dlrs.
    A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group was
studying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugar
along with a possible share offering in the Paris unit, but
gave no details.
    The flotation plan has been interpreted by financial
analysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of the
CPC business.
    In London yesterday, chairman of Belgian starch producer
&lt;Amylum NV&gt; Pierre Callebaut told Reuters that since Ferruzzi
was ""apparently still organising finance,"" his company might
still succeed with its rival bid for the CPC business.
    Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said the 630
mln dlrs agreed for the CPC acquisition would be paid ""at the
date foreseen in the preliminary contract.""
    Gardini could not reveal the date in question nor give any
indication of the likely timing of an offering of shares in
European Sugar, but it was announced last week that Ferruzzi's
purchase of the CPC business was expected to be completed by
September 30.
    Callebaut said yesterday that Amylum was surprised and
disappointed that its 675 mln dlr bid cash offer for CPC's
European business was apparently rejected in favour of
Ferruzzi's lower bid.
    Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said ""Amylum
should know that one succeeds in a bid by making the right
offer at the right moment - exactly as Ferruzzi did in the case
of the acquisition of CPC's European business.""
    Gardini said it was not Callebaut's business to concern
himself with the European Sugar capital raising operation under
study, he added.
    Asked about press reports that Ferruzzi might follow up the
European Sugar flotation with the sale of 49 pct of the CPC
business, Gardini said: ""We do not exclude having minority
partners in the CPC business."" He declined to elaborate.

<title>GAF &lt;GAF&gt; SEEKS ALL OF BORG-WARNER &lt;BOR&gt;</title>
<dateline>    WAYNE, N.J., March 31 - </dateline>GAF Corp said it has made an all
cash merger proposal to Borg-Warner Corp at 46 dlrs per share
for all the company's common stock.
    Following a meeting yesterday with Borg-Warner officials
and investment bankers, GAF said, it is today delivering a
letter to the Borg-Warner board outling the terms of the
proposal that would be made by tender offer, pursuant to a
mutually acceptable merger agreement to be approved by the
Borg-Warner board and conditioned on that board's
recommendation of the tender offer and merger.
    GAF, in its letter, stated it intends to finance the
proposed acquisition entirely with its own funds and bank
borrowings under a syndicated bank loan from a group of banks
led by Chase Manhattan Corp's &lt;CMB&gt; Chase Manhattan Bank.
    Last week, GAF increased its ownership of Borg-Warner
shares to 19.9 pct of those outstanding Minstar Inc &lt;MNST&gt; sold
its 12.4 pct holding.
    GAF emphasized ""the amicable nature of the proposed
transaction,"" which it characterized as a partnership.
    GAF said it wanted to discuss with the Borg-Warner board 
key roles for Borg-Warner's senior management in the new
organization, board representation for Borg-Warner directors on
a newly constituted board, and a company name change.
    GAF said it will be filing an amendment to its 13-D with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
    Borg-Warner has about 85.6 mln common shares outstanding.
    Minstar chairman Irwin L. Jacobs sold his stake after
Borg-Warner after the company failed to respond to his
mid-February offer for a negotiated agreement at a minimum
price of 44 dlrs a share.
    In November, Jacobs had offered to enter into acquisition
talks with Borg-Warner based on a price of between 43 and 48

<title>AKZO PLANNING US INVESTMENTS</title>
<dateline>    ARNHEM, Netherlands, March 31 -  </dateline>Dutch chemicals group Akzo

this year by making small acquisitions in the US.
   Akzo chairman Aarnoud Loudon told a news conference on its
1986 report that the company wanted to achieve the same level
of US investments it had before it divested its fibre firm
American Enka in December 1985, when US investments represented
20 pct of Akzo's total capital.
   The US expansion plans were not an attempt to compensate for
losses in guilder income through the lower dollar, Loudon said.
    He said a more important factor was the speed of growth in
the US, adding ""It's the largest industrial market in the world.""
But he said the company would also be looking at possible
acquisitions in Europe.
    Despite its highly liquid cash flow, Akzo did not plan
acquisitions on a scale that would negatively influence the
company's debt/equity ratio, Loudon said.
   The chairman said in the past two years Akzo had spent 1.1
billion guilders on acquisitions, of which nearly two thirds
were in the United States.

<title>KEYCORP &lt;KEY&gt; AGREES TO ACQUIRE UTAH BANK</title>
<dateline>    ALBANY, N.Y., March 31 - </dateline>Keycorp said it has signed a
definitive agreement to acquire Commercial Security Bancorp
&lt;CSEC&gt; by exchanging Keycorp common valued at 63 dlrs for each
Commercial Securities share.
    Keycorp said this gives the transaction an indicated value
of 102 mln dlrs.
    Keycorp said the amount of its stock to be exchanged will
be based on the daily average closing price of the shares for
an unspecified period prior to the closing of the acquisition.
    Based on a maximum of about 2.75 Keycorp shares and a
minimum of about 1.8 Keycorp to be exchanged, the agreement
provides that if the average price of Keycorp common is less
than 21.50 dlrs a share during the pricing period, the
agreement will terminate unless a new conversion ratio can be
negotiated.
    Keycorp said the transaction is designed to be tax free to
Commercial Security shareholders. The company said it will
treat the merger as a pooling of interests.
    It said the proposal is subject to approval by Commercial
Security shareholders and various regulators.
    Keycorp said the merger is expected to become effective as
soon as possible after December 31, 1987, the date Utah's
interstate banking law becomes operational.
    Keycorp said Richard K. Hemingway and certain members of
the Hemingway family who own about 30 pct of Commercial

<title>GENCORP &lt;GY&gt; ALTERNATIVE PLAN DUE WITHIN A WEEK</title>
<dateline>    AKRON, Ohio, March 31 - </dateline>A. William Reynolds, chairman and
chief executive of GenCorp Inc, told shareholders he expects to
announce a company alternative to a 100-dlr-per-share hostile
tender within a week.
    Last night the company urged shareholders to reject the
tender. Reynolds urged shareholders to be patient, saying the
group sponsoring the tender offer had months to evaluate
GenCorp while ""we have had only 10 days to respond.""
    Reynolds also disclosed the company has resolved legal
challenges to its planned sale of WOR TV, serving the New York
City market, and expects to complete the sale by Friday.
    Reynolds said the company expects to book an after tax gain
of 250 mln dlrs from the sale of WOR TV. The company plans to
sell the station to MCA Inc &lt;MCA&gt; for 387 mln dlrs.
    Reynolds did not specify whether the legal challenges were
dropped or dismissed. The Federal Communications Commission has
already approved the station's sale.
    Money from the sale of the station will play a role in
helping develop an alternative to the tender offer co-sponsored
by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG&gt; and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds
said. He provided no other details.
    Randall Hubbard, chairman of AFG, and Joel Reed, chief
financial officer of Wagner and Brown, attended the meeting,
which was shifted from a tire plant to a downtown hotel. About
300 people were present despite an overnight snowstorm.
    Hubbard and Reed chatted briefly with Reynolds after the
meeting but declined to discuss their proposal with reporters.
    Reynolds told the shareholders friends and family members
have been telling him ""Bill, just don't pay greenmail"" to end
the takeover threat. Greenmail describes a buyout of a minority
shareholder at a price not available to other holders. Reynolds
said he considers it a ""repugnant device.""
    Shareholders elected management's slate of 11 directors.
Mario Gabelli, head of a New York investment firm which owns a
large block of stock, proposed one nominee for the board.
Gabelli said the unsuccessful attempt was designed to ""stiffen
the backbone of the board to discourage greenmail.""
    Hubbard and Reed reiterated previous statements that they
are open to negotiations with GenCorp.
    Asked about severance contracts for key executives in the
event of a shift in control of the company, Reynolds asserted
""we're developing alternatives that would not result in a
change in control.""
    Asked whether the company's plan would be superior to any
proposal of AFG and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds commented, ""We
know the company, we know the values and we know the
opportunities better than any outside group.""
    In response to a question about whether any units are up
for sale, he said only that GenCorp is evaluating alternatives.

<title>TALKING POINT/BORG-WARNER CORP &lt;BOR&gt;</title>
<author>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    New York, March 31 - </dateline>Borg-Warner Corp will vigorously
resist GAF Corp's 46-dlr-per-share takeover offer, but the
Midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer,
either from GAF or its own management, analysts believe.
    Analysts also said Borg-Warner may attempt to escape GAF
through a restructuring. The speculation pushed Borg-Warner's
stock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading.
    Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will
stage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he can
add its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF.
    ""It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin)
Jacobs that they don't want to be taken over. The question is
now do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively, they want
to remain independent,"" said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps.
    Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation
for almost a year. Last week, Jacobs' investment vehicle,
Minstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mln
Borg-Warner shares. The same day, GAF Corp raised its stake by
9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding.
    Jacobs was interested in buying the company, but took no
steps toward a transaction.
    ""Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them for
the last nine months. It's been one of the dullest corporate
battles I've seen,"" said one analyst.
    The battle, however, has heated up, and the range of
breakup values on Wall Street span from the current market
price to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said they
think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate.
    Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on
its 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner.
    Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up
with Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials
company in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted an
unsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp, but GAF benefited
from that company's restructuring.
    ""Borg Warner can't quibble that it's not a legitimate
offer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of
between a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a
46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it's sweetened. I
personally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs per
share,"" said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson.
    Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a
restructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James
Goldsmith. The company bought back the financier's stock and
carried out a wider share repurchase.
    Arbitragers, however, said they do not believe Heyman is
seeking ""greenmail,"" or the repurchase of his stock by the
company at a premium.
    Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with
financing the transaction.
    Previously associated with ""junk bond"" experts, Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc, GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warner
takeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tender
offer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArner
board and conditioned on the board's recommendation of the
tender offer and merger.
    Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects a
merger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employees
since the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts, however,
believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay
debt from the transaction.
    GAF's stock rose 1-5/8 today, to 48-5/8.
   ""I believe, obviously, if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at the
level it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values
substantially,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose.
    He said at 46 dlrs per share, Heyman's average cost for the
company's stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF's
current holdings.
    Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business,
which makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman.
Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg's earnings.
    The plastics are used in telephone equipment, office
equipment and appliances. ""Borg has half the market in the U.S.
and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator,""
Rose said. Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW&gt; and
Monsanto Corp &lt;MTC&gt;, he said.
    Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business, and a
protective systems business, which includes Wells Fargo
security guards. It also has an information services business,
and is trying to sell its financial services business.
    Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share on
revenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986. Smaller GAF, in 1986,
earned on an operating basis 80.7 mln dlrs or 2.22 dlrs per
share on sales of 753.8 mln dlrs.
    GAF's net earnings included an after tax gain of 201.4 mln
from its participation in a Union Carbide exchange offer, a
special union carbide dividend, and the sale of its Union
Carbide shares.

if GAF's 46 dlr-per-share offer to acquire Borg-Warner is
successful.
    ""We have great respect for Borg-Warner mangagement,"" Heyman
said, following a speech at the American Institute of Chemical
Engineers annual meeting. ""We don't have any particular changes
in mind.""
    Earlier today, GAF announced that a 3.16-billion-dlr-offer
was presented to the board of directors of the Chicago-based
company.
    Last week, GAF had purchased additional shares of the
company for 40-1/8 dlrs, increasing its stake in Borg-Warner to
19.9 pct.
    In 1985, GAF made an unsuccessful effort to acquire Union
Carbide Corp for five billion dlrs, and has since expressed an
interest in acquiring a chemical company that would complement
its own chemical business.
    When asked whether GAF would consider selling the
non-chemical assets of Borg-Warner if its takeover offer is
accepted, Heyman declined to comment.
    He also refused to say whether GAF would consider
increasing its the dollar value of its takeover offer if the
initial proposal is rejected.
    Heyman emphasized that he considered the GAF offer to
Borg-Warner to be a friendly one.
    ""We think we made a fair offer that is good for Borg-Warner
management and good for its shareholders,"" Heyman said.
     In his speech, Heyman said he feared too many chemical
companies were attempting to specialize in the same high margin
niche products.
    He said they were turning their backs on core commodity
chemical businesses. 
    Heyman said the chemical industry has taken a total of
seven billion dlrs in pre-tax writeoffs during the past two
years to trim balance sheets.
    He predicted that the U.S. chemical industry, which
reported a total of 13 billion dlrs in 1986 profits, would see
a 20 pct gain in earnings this year because of increasing
exports, cheaper feedstock costs and the weakened U.S. dlr.

<dateline>    WILTON, Conn., March 31 - </dateline>Emery Air Freight Corp said it
plans to begin tomorrow a 40 dlr a share tender offer for 83
pct of the outstanding common stock of Purolator Courier Corp.
    The company said the tender offer is the first step in a
plan to buy 100 pct of the Purolator shares.
    Following the tender offer, Emery said it would offer 40
dlrs of junior subordinated debentures for each remaining
Purolator share outstanding.
    On March one, Purolator agreed to a 35 dlr a share
leveraged buyout by eight Purolator executives and EF Hutton
LBO Inc, a unit of EF Hutton Group Inc.
    Emery said it had tried unsuccessfully to open merger
discussions with Purolator before the company accepted the
management-led buyout offer.
    In a letter to Purolator's chairman, Nicholas F. Brady,
Emery's chairman, John C. Emery, said the company would still
prefer to negotiate with Purolator.
    But he said the imminent expiration of the leveraged buyout
group's offer has forced the company to make an unsolicited
tender offer of its own.
    Emery said its offer is scheduled to expire at 2400 EST on
April 28, unless extended.
    The company said conditions of the offer include the
receipt of at least two-thirds of Purolator's shares
outstanding, on a fully diluted basis, and the repeal of its
share purchase rights plan.
    Emery said the offer is also subject to completion of the
previously announced sale of Purolator's Canadian operations.
    Emery said Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, Morgan Guaranty
Trust Co and Salomon Bros had agreed to provide financing for
the tender offer.
    It said the junior subordinated debentures to be issued in
the subsequent merger will carry a 13 pct annual interest rate,
payable twice a year.
    For the first three years after the notes are issued,
interest will be paid, at Emery's option, in cash or in
additional notes, Emery said.
    It added that the notes will not be subject to redemption
for one year after they are issued.
    Emery said Purolator would operate as a wholly owned unit
of the company after the merger. It said it hoped Purolator's
management would continue with the company.
    ""We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fit
with each other and that the combination will enable each of us
to better serve our existing customers and meet the challenges
of the future,"" Emery's chairman said in his letter.
    He said a merger would significantly enhance the financial
turnaround that Purolator's management had previously forecast.
    Officials at Purolator could not immediately be reached for
comment on the offer, which was released several hours after
the stock market had closed.
    Emery's stock closed up 1/2 at 12-5/8.
    Purolator closed at 34-7/8, off 5/8.

<title>U.S. SUPREME COURT ALLOWS DELTA-WESTERN MERGER</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </dateline>U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunction
blocking the planned merger of Delta &lt;DAL&gt; Airlines
Inc and Western Airlines &lt;WAL&gt;, the Court said.
    O'Connor's action came hours after a three-judge panel of
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had
blocked the merger until a dispute over union representation
had been settled by arbitration.
    A Supreme Court spokesman said O'Connor granted a stay of
the injuction, allowing the merger, worth nearly 860 mln dlrs,
to go through as planned later today.
    The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details. Each
of the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over a
particular regional Appellate circuit and has the power to
provisionally overturn its rulings without comment.
    The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials of
Atlanta-based Delta, which had been preparing for the merger
for months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanes
belonging to Western, which has headquartera in Los Angeles.
    ""Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight,""
Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution late
last night. ""There was really very little that remained to be
done.""
    The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had been
filed in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air Transport
Employees union sought to force Western's management to fulfill
a promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger took
place.
    The airlines argued that Western's promise could not be
enforced in a takeover by a larger company.
    After learning of the appeals court ruling, Delta officials
last night spread the word by telephone that Western employees
should report for work today in their old uniforms, not in new
Delta outfits.
    Delta announced last September that it was purchasing
Western. The merger took place in December, and Western has
been operated as a Delta subsidiary since then. The Western
name was to have disappeared at midnight last night.
    At issue is whether the Western unions would continue to
represent Western employees after the integration of the two
airlines.
    While all but eight pct of Western's 11,000 employees are
unionized, only Delta's pilots are union members.
    Delta had maintained that the three unions having contracts
with Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and the
Teamsters, as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be
""extinguished"" after today.

    Due to the transaction, Horn and Hardart is projecting a

of sale, lease and re-franchise agreements.

Bojangles' restaurants and is in accordance with its
restructuring program announced in October 1986.
    A spokesman said the company is considering the sale or
spinoff of the 91-company owned additional restaurants, which
are profitable.
    The company said the disposition will result in no profit

<title>CONRAC &lt;CAX&gt; EXPLORING RESTRUCTURING, BUYOUT</title>
<dateline>     WASHINGTON, April 1 - </dateline>Conrac Corp, whose board has
rejected a 25 dlr a share tender offer from Mark IV Industries
Inc &lt;IV&gt;, said it is exploring alternatives such as a
restructuring, leveraged buyout or takeover of the company.
     In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Conrac said its board of directors authorized its financial and
legal advisors to explore a several alternatives to the Mark IV
offer, which it said it considers inadequate.
    The alternatives being explored include a restructuring,
leveraged buyout or a takeover of the company by another
company, Conrac said.
    Conrac, which said its board discussed the alternatives at
special meetings on March 26 and 30, said that its decision on
whether to adopt any of the alternatives would hinge on ""the
future actions of Mark IV"" and its unsolicitied tender offer.
    Putting into effect any of the alternatives being explored
could hurt or defeat the Mark IV offer, it said.
    Board members were also instructed to keep confidential the
terms of any transaction that might be entered into until it
becomes final, the company said.
    The board also took other defensive steps, including
granting severance agreements to some officers, it said.
    At a board meeting yesterday, Concac's directors deleted a
provision allowing the holder of at least one-third of of all
classes of its voting stock to call a special shareholders
meeting and deleted another provision allowing shareholders to
remove directors without cause, the company said.
    The defensive moves were taken because Mark IV had said it
planned to elect a majority of its designees as directors at a
special holders meeting if it succeeded in acquring a majority
of the company's common stock in the offer, Conrac said.
    Conrac's president, vice president and treasurer were given
severance agreements, or ""golden parachutes,"" it said.
    Under the agreements, Conrac President Paul Graf would get
a cash payment of twice his annual salary, which was 209,906
dlrs last year, if there were a change of control in the
company, including acquisition of 30 pct or more of the
company's voting stock, Conrac said.
    Treasurer Joseph Smorada and Vice President Joseph
O'Donnell, who made 143,325 dlrs last year, would get
one-and-a-half times his salary if there were a change in
control. Smorada's salary was not listed in the SEC filing.
    The executives would also get cash settlements of options

<title>TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER &lt;PCC&gt;</title>
<author>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    New York, April 1 - </dateline>Emery Air Freight Corp topped a
leveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40
mln dlrs, but Wall Street is reacting as though another offer
may surface.
    Purolator's stock climbed 5-3/8 today, to 40-1/8, 1/4 over
Emery's 40 dlr per share offer. Emery topped a 35 dlr per share
or 268 mln dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc.
    Some analysts said the latest, 306 mln dlr offer for
Purolator exceeded their expectations.
    Several analysts previously had said they saw takeover
values for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per share
range. At least one, however, estimated the company could be
taken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
    Analysts today would not venture to say whether another
offer could be made, but some arbitragers still held to the
belief that the bidding could go higher.
    ""They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer.
Emery has shown the courage to go forth,"" said one arbitrager,
who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as
bidders.
    ""It makes sense,"" said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey.
But ""It won't make out as well as they think. They won't get a
100 pct of the synergies.""
    Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings in
the short term, but long term, after eliminating redundancies
and selling other Purolator assets, it should boost Emery's
profitability.
    Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rival
United Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. package
delivery company after Federal Express Corp &lt;FDX&gt;, which has 47
pct of the market.
    Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator would
have about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery
business.
    ""This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight
(delivery) business, but it will not make them a power house,""
said Douglas Arthur of Kidder, Peabody and Co.
    Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer, and
its chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call.
    E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer,
but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on
its offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST.
    One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely
Hutton will attempt another offer. However, he was skeptical a
company outside the package delivery industry would want to
outbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same 
synergies as a courier company.
    Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by some
of its management and the E.F. Hutton Group &lt;EFH&gt; subsidiary,
speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come.
    The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolator
board member, Doresy Gardner resigned in March. Gardner said he
believed a better offer could be made by another entity.
    A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director had
no contact with Emery, nor did he have any other buyers lined
up for Purolator.
    Purolator's deal with Hutton was also called into question
by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week, which attempted
to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth.
Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday.
    Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer could
be bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning to
keep its cash tied up in Purolator. Hutton is providing a 279
mln dlr ""bridge"" loan that would later be replaced with other
debt. Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator.
    Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n
its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its
279 mln dlr loan.
    Emery last year lost 5.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887.5 mln
dlrs. Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs in
revenues.

Wertheim and Co said.
    Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could be
set or some progress made on an out-of-court settlement.
    The suit, filed by Polaroid in April 1976, charges that
Kodak infringed upon Polaroid's instant camera patent. In
October 1985, the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or
film that infringe upon the patent, the Polaroid spokesman
said.
    Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any
progress will be made in tomorrow's hearing.
    Ellmann said the stock may have also gotten a boost today
from some optimism concerning new products the company is
currently working on.
    ""Polaroid's announcement that a particularly senior company
executive had been chosen to work on a major unidentified new
product spurred some speculation about their products,"" he
said. ""I am speculating that the new product could be an
electronic still camera,"" referring to a camera that records
its images on magnetic disks as opposed to conventional film.

<title>C AND W OFFERED ROLE IN NEW JAPAN TELECOM COMPANY</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 2 - </dateline>A Japanese businessman announced plans for
a new telecommunications firm in which Britain's Cable and
Wireless Plc would be a core company.
    However, the plan, unveiled by senior Federation of
Economic Organizations official Fumio Watanabe, does not
specify what stake Cable and Wireless would have.
    ""The share holdings of the core companies should be equal,""
Watanabe said in a statement. ""The actual percentage of
shareholdings should be agreed by the core companies.""
    He said the eight core companies will provide directors for
the firm.
    ""The new company shall immediately set to work on the
feasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself,""
Watanabe said.
    Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups,
one of which included C and W, seeking to compete against
&lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd&gt;, which now monopolizes Japan's
overseas telephone business.
    The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wants
only one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe's efforts.
    A British source, who declined to be identified further,
said the proposals could open the door to further talks between
C and W &lt;CAWL.L&gt; and the other firms involved.
    C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal which
would have given it a five pct share in the new
telecommunications firm, compared to the less than three pct
stake Watanabe originally proposed. C and W has a 20 pct stake
in one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge.
    The British source said the decision not to specify the
exact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the door
open for further discussion.
    ""It's probably a sensible approach on their part,"" the
British source told reuters.
    C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay a
new cable between Japan and the U.S.
    The proposed merger has sparked an international row, with
British government sources threatening retaliatory action
against Japan for what they see as discriminatory practices
against foreign firms.
    The sources said last Friday that one option for Britain
would be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securities
companies operating in London.
    The U.S. Has also attacked the original merger plans,
saying that both rival consortia should be licensed.
    Asked about participation by other U.S. And European firms,
Watanabe said, ""They will not be core companies but if they wish
they could participate."" Under the Japanese law, total foreign
participation would be limited to one-third.
    ""It might be wise for C and W to join the new firm which has
the support of many influential backers and work within this
for the realization of their ideas,"" Watanabe told reporters.
    The other core firms are Mitsubishi Corp &lt;MITT.T&gt;, Mitsui
and Co &lt;MITS.T&gt;, Sumitomo Corp &lt;SUMT.T&gt;, Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co &lt;MC.T&gt;, Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T&gt;, C Itoh and Co
&lt;CITT.T&gt;, and &lt;Pacific Telesis International Inc&gt;.
    Watanabe said that his latest proposal represented his
final effort.
    If it fails to satisfy the British government, it will be
up to the Japanese government to explain its position, he said.

<title>COMPROMISE CITED ON SAN MIGUEL SHARES</title>
<dateline>    MANILA, April 2 - </dateline>&lt;San Miguel Corp&gt;, SMC, and &lt;United
Coconut Planters Bank&gt;, UCPB, have reached a compromise on a
disputed block of 38.1 mln shares of SMC, the head of a
government panel that controls the sequestered shares said.
    Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government (PCGG) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126
pesos per share for the block, held in trust by the UCPB.
    ""It looks good,"" Diaz said. But he added several issues,
including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares,
had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to the
sale.
    The PCGG's sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted
SMC's bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the
UCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares were
actually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate of
former President Ferdinand Marcos.
    Cojuango, who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB when
he fled last year after Marcos was toppled, personally owned 24
mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration.
    ""The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are
owned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers,"" Diaz said. ""Naturally we do
not want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies.""
    PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down
payment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary
Neptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year.
    The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be
forfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to
fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally
negotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos.
    PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines' largest food and
beverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln ""B"" class shares
from the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a
price of 150 pesos per share.
    The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion peso
transaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500
mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred
shares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollected
dividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to
UCPB-controlled trading companies.
    The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share
made by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15
pct stock dividend declared in June last year.
    A spokesman for SMC said the company's 15-member board met
today to discuss the proposed compromise.
    The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board
meeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration.
    President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to
set up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership
issue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15.
    Eduardo de Los Angeles, a government nominee in the SMC
board, filed a formal complaint before the Securities and
Exchange Commission last week, accusing Soriano and eight other
directors of violating ""fiduciary duty.""
    De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC's
board last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan.

<title>RANK MAKES INCREASED AVANA OFFER FINAL</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 2 - </dateline>Ranks Hovis McDougall Plc &lt;RHML.L&gt; said
it was making an increased and final offer for the Avana Group
Plc &lt;AVNA.L&gt;. The company already holds about 22.9 pct or 7.1
mln Avana ordinary shares.
    It said in a statement the terms of the offer will be 13
new Rank Hovis shares for every five Avana ordinary shares,
valuing each Avana share at 829p.
    Avana shareholders will be entitled to receive and retain
the net interim dividend of 5.25p per Avana share for the year
ending 28 March 1987.
    Accepting Avana shareholders will also be entitled to
receive Ranks Hovis's forecast net interim dividend of 2.65p
for the financial year ending 5 September 1987.
    Ranks Hovis said that full acceptance of the increased
offer would result in the issue of a maximum of 72.3 mln new
Ranks Hovis shares or about 20 pct of the enlarged issued
ordinary share capital of the company.
    The latest offer will lapse on 17 April. Ordinary
shareholders in Avana who accept the increased offer will have
the opportunity to elect for cash for all or part of their
holdings on the basis of 800p cash for each Avana share.
    Ranks Hovis said the cash required for the cash alternative
would be met by one of several methods.
    For the first 10 mln Avana shares received opting for the
cash alternative, Ranks Hovis would make a cash payment from
its own resources.
    For cash alternatives of more than 10 mln Avana shares,
Morgan Grenfell, as agent for participants, will make a
separate offer to purchase at 300p per share, net of expenses,
up to 46.3 mln Ranks Hovis new shares to which such
shareholders will be entitled under the increased offer. This
is equivalent to 780p per Avana ordinary.
    In addition, Ranks Hovis will make a further cash payment
of 20p per Avana ordinary. Avana shares traded at 800p after
the announcement, 32p up from last night's close of 768p. REUTER

<title>CABLE UNIMPRESSED BY NEW JAPANESE TELECOMS OFFER</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 2 - </dateline>Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L&gt; said new
proposals unveiled by Japan for it to become a core member of a
merged telecommunications firm to compete for
telecommunications contracts did not remove the group's
objections.
    The suggestions by Federation of Economic Organisations
official Fumio Watanabe was a formal announcement of proposals
made earlier this week and reported in the Japanese press.
    Cable has a 20 pct stake in one of the two groups trying to
compete against Japan's &lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd&gt; which
monopolises Japan's overseas telephone business.
    But a Cable spokesman said it still believed a merger of
the two consortia would be impracticable. ""They are like oil and
water,"" he said.
    The Japanese authorities want only one competitor and have
proposed that the two consortia band together. The issue has
been taken up by the British government as a test case on the
openness of Japanese markets. Watanabe's latest proposals said
that the eight core companies of the new group should have
equal share holdings but added that they could work out the
precise percentages amongst themselves.
    The reports earlier this week said that Cable would be
offered a five pct stake, up from an originally proposed three
pct.
    Despite the apparent differences in stakes offered, the
Cable spokesman said the two offers appeared to be essentially
the same.
    Cable shares at 1100 GMT were quoted nine pence firmer at
374p.

<title>DECISION EXPECTED ON U.K ROYAL ORDNANCE SALE</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 2 - </dateline>U.K. Defence secretary George Younger is
expected to announce the government's decision on the sale of
state-owned arms manufacturer &lt;Royal Ordnance&gt; today,
parliamentary sources said.
    The government originally intended to float the munitions
and explosives concern on the stock market, but last July said
a private sale was a more appropriate way to dispose of the
firm.
    The bidders for the company were British Aerospace Plc
&lt;BAEL.L&gt; and engineering group GKN Plc &lt;GKN.L&gt;. Royal Ordnance
sold its Leeds tank factory last summer to Vickers Plc

    Defence electronics manufacturer Ferranti Plc &lt;FNTI.L&gt; and
shipping and property group Trafalgar House Plc &lt;THSL.L&gt; both

    Royal Ordnance made pre-tax profits of 26 mln stg on sales
of 487 mln stg in calendar 1985, its first full year of
commercial operation. The company has assets of around 240 mln

<title>TALKING POINT/SANTA FE SOUTHERN &lt;SFX&gt;</title>
<author>    By Philip Barbara, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, April 3 - </dateline>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp may have
more difficulty combining its two railroads than fending off a
possible takeover by Henley Group &lt;HENG&gt;, which has accumulated
almost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroad
conglomerate, analysts said.
    Takeover speculation has surrounded Santa Fe since Henley
disclosed its stake in the company earlier this week, but
analysts and a Santa Fe official were skeptical a takeover is
its intention.
    Analysts also said the company has strong defenses that
would easily deter any suitor - one of those being its problems
combining its two railroad properties, which hang in regulatory
limbo.
    Richard Fischer of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc said that Santa
Fe at December 31 had 580 mln dlrs in cash and cash
equivalents, while its long-term debt to capital was just over
25 pct. ""This gives them plenty of borrowing power,"" he said,
which could be used against an unwanted suitor.
    Henley Group's Chairman Michael Dingman has said he wants
to take major positions in undervalued natural resource
companies. He also told Reuters in an interview he is seeking
an acquisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs.
    Santa Fe officials don't appear concerned that Henley might
launch a takeover. ""I would not characterize the atmosphere
around here as one of concern,"" one Santa Fe executive said
about Henley.
    ""I think it's wrong to assume Dingman has formed a firm
strategy with Santa Fe,"" said Mark Hassenberg, who covers
Henley for DLJ Securities.
    Analysts say the potential of Santa Fe's land assets are
likely to be realized slowly. They add that Santa Fe's efforts
to merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo,
sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeable
future.
    These realities, they said, support the Henley Group's
statement that its Santa Fe stake is only an investment.
    The more pressing problem facing Santa Fe is overcoming
difficulties in merging its two railroads, the Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fe Railway Co and Southern Pacific Transportation Co.
The merger would create the nation's second-longest railroad.
    Last July the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) denied
the merger on anticompetitive grounds.
    The company since has granted trackage-sharing rights to
four western railroads to meet the ICC's concerns and persuade
it to reopen the hearings in its three-year-old struggle to
merge the lines.
    ""My guess is the commission will decide in three to six
weeks whether to reopen hearings,"" Fischer said.
    ""I believe they've made an effort to satisfy the ICC's
objections,"" he said. ""But in doing so they haven't pleased
everyone. Before they had Burlington Northern on their side,
now Burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are set
up.""
    If the hearings are reopened, analysts predicted it will
take six to nine months for everyone to have their say, and up
to another year for the ICC to decide.
    Santa Fe is in the midst of a 50-mln-share stock buyback
program begun in 1984. It has bought back 33.7 mln shares as of
February 1, when it had 154.7 mln shares outstanding, a
spokesman said.
    Among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned by
Norfolk Southern, one of 3.4 mln shares bought in 1986 and
another of 1.7 mln shares in 1985, one analyst said.
    James Voytko at Paine Webber believes Santa Fe could fight
off the Henley Group with its cash and credit. Citing the share
buybacks from Norfolk Southern, he said one of Santa Fe's
options, if threatened, could be to buy the Henley stake.
    ""It is indeed possible that Dingman sees this as a
low-risk, opportunistic investment,"" Voytko said.
    ""People who follow Santa Fe have given me values of 45 dlrs
to 50 dlrs a share,"" said DLJ Securities' Hassenberg. ""But I'm
certain that in Dingman's mind, the company is worth more than
that in breakup value.""

<title>SEC CLARIFIES POSITION ON TENDER OFFER CHANGES</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </dateline>The Securities and Exchange
Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for
the shares of companies that they must extend the period their
offers are open if key conditions are changed.
    Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers
for companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide to
eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be
tendered in order for the offers to be valid.
    Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions.
As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares
that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached.
    In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said
clarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tender
offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived,
even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so.
    The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share
condition is a ""material change"" of the tender offer under U.S.
securities law, SEC officials said.
    The SEC has already said that other specific material
changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being
sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a
tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer.
    The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving
shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender
offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share
conditions were waived.
    SEC officials said the length of the extension in such
cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding
each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days.
    The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers
of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each
offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new
information. Officials declined to identify the two offers.
    ""If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of
its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate
dissemination,"" the SEC said.
    Federal securities law requires that all tender offers
remain open for at least 20 business days.

<title>AUSTRALIAN GAS LIGHT CO COUNTER-BIDS FOR TMOC</title>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, April - </dateline>&lt;The Australian Gas Light Co&gt; (AGL) said it
will offer one share plus one dlr cash for every two shares in
oil and gas producer &lt;TMOC Resources Ltd&gt; in a counter-bid to
the previously reported takeover offer by Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S&gt;.
    The offer values TMOC shares at 4.75 dlrs each, based on
AGL's closing price of 8.50 dlrs on Friday. TMOC shares jumped
to 4.60 dlrs on the announcement from its Friday closing price
of 4.15.
    The AGL offer, the third to be made for TMOC this year,
compares with the Santos cash offer of 4.00 dlrs a share.
    Based on TMOC's issued capital of 62.08 mln shares, the AGL
offer values the entire company at 249.9 mln shares.
    AGL said in a statement that it already holds 10.5 pct of
TMOC's issued capital. This compares with the Santos stake of
3.1 pct when it announced its bid in March 23.
    &lt;Elders Resources Ltd&gt; began the auction for TMOC about
three months ago with an unsuccessful 2.55 dlrs a share
on-market offer that has since lapsed.
    AGL said its offer is above the upper end of the range of
values placed on TMOC by its advisers in the company's response
urging rejection of the Elders Resources bid.
    AGL said it will make the same offer for TMOC's convertible
notes. Accepting share and note holders will participate in
AGL's planned one-for-one bonus issue.
    It said TMOC is already a partner with AGL in the Alice
Springs to Darwin gas pipeline and has a number of businesses
complementary with those of AGL.
    AGL is the New South Wales natural gas utility while TMOC
has extensive onshore holdings, mainly in Queensland where it
owns the Moonie oil field and in the Northern Territory where
it operates and holds 43.75 of the Mereenie oil-gas field. It

entered into an agreement with E.F. Hutton Group Inc EFH under
which Hutton will terminate its merger agreement with Purolator
Courier Corp and its pending 35-dlr-per-share tender offer,
effective April 13.
    Under its merger agreement, Hutton has the right to
unilaterally terminate the merger agreement under certain
circumstances, including its receipt of less than 66-2/3 pct of
Purolator shares or the start of a higher competing tender
offer, such as Emery's competing 40 dlr per share offer for

pct, of Purolator shares had been tendered and not withdrawn,
down from an 11.5 pct interest held earlier.
    Emery's bid expires April 28.
    Emery said pending the termination of PC Acquisition's
merger agreement, PC has released Purolator from an agreement
not to discuss Emery's acquisition proposal with Emery. Emery
said as a result it is renewing its request that Purolatr enter
into merger negotiations with it.

PC Acquisition's right to receive fees that Purolator agreed to
pay if PC were unsuccessful in acquiring control of Purolator

""financially superior alternative.""
    GenCorp said it would annouce details of its plans to buy
back 54 pct of its stock for 1.6 billion dlrs, or 130 dlrs a
share, later this week. GenCorp's buy back was made to fend off
the hostile 2.3 billion dlr, 100-dlr-a-share, tender offer by
AFG and Wagner and Brown.
    Earlier today AFG and Wagner and Brown said that without
the benefit of additional information available to GenCorp's
management, it cannot compete economically with GenCorp's
proposal.
    The group said it is ending its tender offer for GenCorp
and promptly return to tendering shareholders all shares
tendered pursuant to its offer.
    The group owns 9.8 pct, or 2,180,608 shares, of GenCorp's
outstanding shares.

<title>ALLEGHENY &lt;AG&gt; PREFERED SHAREHOLDERS FILE SUIT</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </dateline>Allegheny International Inc, which has
agreed to a merge with a jointly-formed First Boston Inc
affiliate in a deal worth 500 mn dlrs, said shareholders of its
preferred stock have filed a class action complaint against the
company.
    The complaint alleges, among other things, that the company
and its board agreed to pay First Boston an illegal seven mln
dlr topping fee if it received a higher offer for the company
prior to the buyout.
    The suit contends that this fee hampers Allegheny's ability
to attract other offers or take other actions that would
benefit holders of preferred stock. The complaint also alleges
federal securities laws violations and breach of fiduciary
duty.
    The suit requests an injunction against proceeding with the
pending offer being made by Sunter Acquisition to acquire
Allegheny. Sunter Acquisition Corp and Sunter Holdings Corp
were formed by First Boston and Allegheny.
    Allegheny said it and the Sunter concerns intend to
vigorously defend the complaint's charges.
    The complaints were filed by Robert Moss and other parties
who are believed to own about 230,000 shares of Allegheny's
preferred stock.
