<title>U.S. SUGAR IMPORTS DOWN IN WEEK - USDA</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </dateline>Sugar imports subject to the U.S.
sugar import quota during the week ended January 9, the initial
week of the 1987 sugar quota year, totaled 5,988 short tons
versus 46,254 tons the previous week, the Agriculture
Department said.
    The sugar import quota for the 1987 quota year

compared with 1,850,000 tons in the 1986 quota year, which was
extended three months to December 31.
    The department said the Customs Service has reported that
weekly and cumulative imports are reported on an actual weight
basis and when final polarizations are received, cumulative
import data are adjusted accordingly.

<title>INDONESIAN SUGAR OUTPUT SEEN SHORT OF TARGET</title>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, March 2 - </dateline>Indonesia's raw sugar output is likely
to be 1.8 mln tonnes in calendar 1987, unchanged from 1986 and
below the government's 1987 forecast of 2.5 mln, the U.S.
Embassy said in its agricultural outlook for 1987.
    Indonesia bought 162,500 tonnes of raw sugar on world
markets in late 1986, the report said.
    The embassy estimated Indonesia's calendar 1986 raw sugar
production at 1.8 mln tonnes, against a government estimate of
1.99 mln.
    It said that Indonesia's move into sugar self-sufficiency
in 1984 may have been short-lived.
    The report said, ""The government continues to promote
sugarcane production through its smallholder intensification
program and a relatively high guaranteed price to sugarcane
producers.
    ""However, there are considerable indications that farmers
are reluctant to plant cane because its economic return is not
as good as that of other crops.""

Mills Association said.
    Total offtake in the first four months of the current year

<title>CUBA TELLS TRADERS SUGAR EXPORTS MAY BE DELAYED</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 2 - </dateline>Cuba has told international sugar
operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that
these contracts will take second place to Cuba's direct
shipments to its export markets, dealers here said.
    Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the
language of the message was not totally clear and some believed
shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet
Union as the destination of their contracts.
    The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last
week and reflect a poor Cuban crop, worry over Brazil's export
availability, and increasing Soviet demand, analysts said.
    Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediately
available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was
probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender
last month.
    Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward
delivery, and last month's spot requirement resulted in the
sale of several cargoes.
    Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive
March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export
markets, traders said.

processor is now likely. ""We are looking again at the

will start trading futures contracts in high fructose corn
syrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week.
    Pat Henderson, spokesperson for the MGE, said the exchange
expects contract approval at CFTC's Tuesday meeting. It has
been under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in
December, 1985.
    The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of
55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tank
truck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet
milling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is most
commonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other
beverages.
    Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production
facilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designated
by the symbol ""HF,"" would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Months
traded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months of
March, May, July, September and December.
    Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with a
minimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuation
of one dlr per CWT.
    ""We hope the producers and users of fructose will be
actively involved, those producers being the large processors,
the corn wet millers, and the users being the beverage
bottlers,"" Henderson said. ""But there are potentials for all
types of people to use it. There is quite a list of industries
that utilize fructose.""

results of today's EC white sugar tender are hard to forecast
because of plans by a group of French, West German, Dutch and
Belgian operators to sell one mln tonnes of sugar into

    London traders said bids for licences have been reported
between 43.00 and 44.00 Ecus per 100 kilos and if any licences

range, possibly 43.30/43.50 Ecus.
    Traders in Paris said they expect maximum rebates of
between 43 and 43.50 Ecus.
    Other than the Commission releasing no sugar for export,
the likely tonnage is expected to be very small, the London
traders said, while the French sources declined to estimate
volume in view of the psychological impact of the planned sales
into intervention in protest against EC export policies.
    Last week licences for 60,500 tonnes were awarded at a

formally accepted and now will be reviewed by the agency.
    The company said the product, with the generic name of
sucralose, is made from sugar and tastes like sugar, but is
about 600 times sweeter.
    It yields no calories and does not promote tooth decay.
    Johnson and Johnson said the sweetner is being jointly
developed with Tate and Lyle PLC &lt;TATL&gt;.
    Tate and Lyle is seeking approval in Canada, the United
Kingdom and other European countries, Johnson and Johnson said.
The company noted its petition covering the product and its
safety evaluation were submitted to the FDA last month.
    While awaiting FDA approval, the company said, it is
proceeding with plans for commercialization through its McNeil
Specialty Products Co subsidiary.
    Johnson and Johnson said it is operating under a licensing
agreement with Tate and Lyle, whose collaborative research with
scientists at Queen Elizabeth College in London led to the
discovery of Sucralose in 1976.
    Patents and licensing agreements control the use of
sucralose through the year 2001, Johnson and Johnson said.
    Sucralose is a chlorinated derivative of ordinary sugar.
The carbon-chloride bonds in sucralose are stable and are not
broken during digestion or metabolism.
    Sucralose is essentially not metabollized by the body. The
chlorine content enhances sweetness without providing calories.

<title>THAI SUGAR PRODUCTION INCREASES</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 11 - </dateline>Thai sugar production totalled 960,788
tonnes in January, an increase of 12.7 pct on January 1986,
according to figures received by the International Sugar
Organization.
    November and December production figures also exceeded last
year's totals with the result that output in the first three
months of the season showed a 23.1 pct increase over 1985/86.
Production in the November 1986 to January 1987 period totalled
1.29 mln tonnes.
    Thai exports in December and January were down, however.
January exports fell from 73,164 to 35,910 tonnes.
    Domestic consumption increased 7.3 pct to 192,069 tonnes
for the three month period, but this was not sufficient to
prevent a significant rise in stocks, which climbed to 1.62 mln
tonnes by the end of January, compared with 1.52 mln a year
earlier.
    Thai Agricultural Ministry officials have previously
forecast a decline in 1986/87 raws output to around 2.3 mln

<title>LICHT SEES STAGNANT EUROPEAN BEET AREA</title>
<dateline>    RATZEBURG, March 11 - </dateline>The overall area devoted to sugar
beet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 7.22
mln hectares compared with 7.21 mln ha in 1986, West German
statistician F.O. Licht said.
    It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices
would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year,
Licht said, but judging by this first estimate the effect was
probably minimal.
    The total beet area in the European Community is forecast
to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986.
    The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha,
against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at
4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln.
    Individual West Europe country estimates, in 1,000 hectares
(with 1986 figures in brackets), are, Belgium/Luxembourg 114
(118), Denmark 69 (69), France 419 (421), Greece 35 (44),
Ireland 36 (38), Italy 270 (275), Netherlands 129 (138),
Portugal 1 (1), Spain 192 (190), U.K. 200 (201), West Germany
385 (399), Austria 32 (28), Finland 30 (31), Sweden 51 (52),
Switzerland 15 (14), Turkey 355 (340), Yugoslavia 160 (136).
    Eastern Europe plantings are forecast as follows, USSR 3400
(3440), Albania 10 (9), Bulgaria 52 (50), Czechoslovakia 195
(196), East Germany 210 (205), Hungary 108 (96), Poland 460
(440), Romania 295 (280).
    On the basis of average yields this year, Licht said these
area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in
1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes, raw value, down from 31.4 mln
tonnes in 1986/87. Licht said sugar yields were fairly high
last season, thanks to favourable weather, and this increases
the chances of a significant reduction in production in
1987/88.
    Based on average yields, EC beet sugar production could
fall nearly 10 pct this year to 13.5 mln tonnes from 14.9 mln
in 1986/87, while total Western Europe production could be 16.9
mln tonnes against 18.1 mln. Eastern Europe production could be
12.9 mln tonnes against 13.3 mln in 1986/87.

<title>EC COMMISSION REJECTS SUGAR THREATS - SOURCES</title>

<title>HUNGARIAN 1987 SUGAR BEET AREA LITTLE CHANGED</title>

<title>CHINA FACES DILEMMA OVER SUGAR IMPORTS</title>
<author>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    PEKING, March 13 - </dateline>China has to decide if it will increase
sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and
rising demand, in view of market predictions that international
sugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and the
official press said.
    He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and
Fisheries, said this week that China has adjusted the
purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in
production last year but he gave no price details.
    One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidly
because of improving living standards and rising demand for
sweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods.
    ""It will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in a
state-controlled economy. China may have to import,"" he said.
    Customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in
1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes in
January 1987 from 54,000 in January 1986.
    The official Economic Information newspaper last month said
production in the 1986/87 crushing season (September-April)
will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand.
    The paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24
mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes.
    ""In the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beet
has fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has dropped
and cannot meet demand that is rising every day,"" it said.
    ""The country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw
down stocks to meet market demand,"" it added.
    It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming the
drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane
and beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmers
refusing to grow them.
    The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three
times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to
seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. He could
sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only
70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane.
    Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have
not changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said.
    In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan
in 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills' profit to 117
yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added.
    The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the
442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losing
money. China has 521 sugar mills.
    A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane
acreage in 1986/87 (September-August) of up to 10 pct in
Guangdong, which produced 45 pct of China's sugar in calendar
1985, and a smaller drop in Fujian, which produced 11 pct of
China's sugar in calendar 1985.
    He said both provinces are more developed than other
sugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities.
    But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for
28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87,
because cane-growing is more economic there, he said.
    He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986.
    A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln
at end-January. ""Now they are falling but (they) have not
reached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,""
he said.
    ""China has options not easily available in western
countries. It controls stocks strictly and can release less
into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly,"" he said.
    The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be
slightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world prices
and serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, are
likely to continue until at least end-1988.
    He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state-owned
mills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers.
    ""Most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many of
them using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s,"" he said.
    He said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annual
four pct, with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct.

<title>CUBA SUGAR CROP SEEN AT LEAST SAME AS LAST YEAR</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 13 - </dateline>Cuban sugar export figures for January
suggest that this year's crop may be at least as large as last
year's 7.35 mln tonnes, according to sugar analysts.
    Exports in January totalled 733,000 tonnes raw value, up
from 725,000 a year earlier, according to figures received by
the International Sugar Organization.
    January is the first major export month and the figures
thus give a good indication of the current crop, they said.
Fourth quarter exports fell to 622,000 tonnes from 909,000
tonnes a year earlier, but this was because Cuba was destocking
at the end of 1985, they added.
    Trade house C Czarnikow recently estimated production this
year at 7.50 mln tonnes.
    Cuban sugar production in the third quarter of 1986 was
12,000 tonnes, giving a final 1985/86 crop total of 7.35 mln
tonnes, compared with a 1984/85 crop of 8.10 mln tonnes.
    There is normally no third quarter production in Cuba, but
a hurricane meant that last year's crop was extended.
    Exports to the USSR were substantially down in January at
362,000 tonnes from 489,000 in January 1986, but other Comecon
countries received 210,000 tonnes, against 80,000 tonnes in the
same month last year, figures received by the ISO show.
    Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania all took
substantially more Cuban sugar.
    Cuba's November 1986 exports totalled 158,000 tonnes,
compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985, and December's total was
237,000 tonnes, down from 518,000 tonnes the year before.
Calendar year exports for 1986 were also lower at 6.69 mln
tonnes against 7.21 mln in 1985 -- the lowest level since
1980's 6.19 mln tonnes, the figures show.

<title>EUROPEAN BEET PLANTINGS SEEN LITTLE CHANGED</title>
<author>    By Douglas Learmond, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 16 - </dateline>European sugar beet plantings are
expected to show little change from last year, despite recent
firmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said.
    A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while,
so far, European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lower
areas, increases are expected in some Eastern European nations.
    Trade analysts said their private reports give similar
results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate
of stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West
German sugar statistician F. O. Licht.
    Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural
experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved
seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this.
In recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a late
boost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointing
starts to growing seasons.
    Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers
will grow so-called ""C"" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world
market. This is what is produced in excess of the basic area
needed to meet the EC ""A"" and ""B"" quotas, which receive full and
partial price support, respectively.
    Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week
between producers and the EC commission over its export policy
could have serious implications for future sugar output.
    Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly
one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as
they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for
the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices.
    However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point,
this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting
higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future
cut in the basic ""A"" and ""B"" quotas, they added.
    In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quota
sugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first
planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last
year's 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year.
    ""The basic trend is towards stability,"" a FIRS spokesman
said. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, white
sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not
encouraging higher planting levels, he said. Beet sugar output
last year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00
tonnes per ha, the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands
but below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11.
    In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans,
since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industry
sources said. The farm ministry said a December survey is still
valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed
by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average.
    Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a
reduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year.
    British Sugar Plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signed
up U.K. Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. This should
yield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year's crop
equalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes.
    British Sugar has ""A"" and ""B"" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnes
of whites and its ""C"" output is due to improved yields from more
consistent disease-resistant seed types.
    Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, Wincenty
Nowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated Sugar
Industry Enterprises, said. World prices are still below Polish
production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to
increase the area above the already signed contracted level.
    The national plan, set before prices began to rise, put
plantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in
1986, Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes.
    World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or
Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to
the domestic market, an official at the national beet growers'
association said. Italian sowings are not yet complete but
surveys suggest a drop from last year's 270,000 ha, especially
in the north where some farmers have switched to soya.
    Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higher
than expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar.
    Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from a
record 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comes
into force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largest
Dutch sugar processor, said.
    The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnes
of white sugar and to cut output of ""C"" sugar. Last year, the
Netherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar
against a combined ""A"" and ""B"" quota of only 872,000 tonnes.
    ""The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher
than it has done recently to make planned production of ""C"" sugar
really worthwhile,"" the spokesman said.
    Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting
intentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year's
Soviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year.
    Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some
95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, but
diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic
demand.
    The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are
estimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year.
    A spokesman for Denmark's largest beet concern, De Danske
Sukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged
from 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha.
    In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domestic
demand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 ha
against 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugar
company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB.
    Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to
late sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987
plantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, down
from 37,600 in 1986.

<title>INDONESIAN SUGAR OUTPUT FORECAST TO RISE IN 1987</title>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, March 17 - </dateline>Indonesian sugar output is forecast by
the government to reach 2.126 mln tonnes in calendar 1987
against projected consumption of 2.039 mln tonnes, Agriculture
Minister Achmad Affandi said.
    Production in 1986, when Indonesia was forced to import
sugar, is officially estimated at 2.016 mln tonnes against
1.728 mln in 1985.
    The U.S. Embassy said in its annual Agriculture Report on
Indonesia there were growing signs that actual output was lower
than official figures. It estimated 1986 production at 1.8 mln
tonnes and forecast little change for 1987.
    Indonesia imported 162,000 tonnes of sugar towards the end
of last year and in early 1987 to boost low stocks.
    Affandi told reporters stocks fel to as low as 159,000
tonnes at the beginning of 1987. Industry sources said this
represented under one month's consumption.
    The minister said Indonesia should hold three months'
supply, or 510,000 tonnes.
    A spokesman for the National Logistics Bureau, which
distributes and stores sugar, said stocks this month were
489,437 tonnes. The harvesting season begins in April.

<title>SUGAR PRICES TOO LOW TO BOOST LATIN OUTPUT</title>
<author>    By Richard Jarvie, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 18 - </dateline>Latin American sugar producers
are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving
to boost production, official and trade sources said.
    Although prices have risen to around eight from five U.S.
Cents per lb in the past six months, they are still below the
region's nine to ten cents per lb average production cost.
    The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the
alert, Manuel Rico, a consultant with the Group of Latin
American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries (GEPLACEA),
told Reuters.
    However, Rico said, it would require another five to seven
cents to stimulate notable increases in output.
    ""Producers are taking measures for increasing their
production when the prices are profitable,"" he said.
    Officials in Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued
rise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leaders
in Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go.
    ""The prices are ridiculous,"" said Julian Mateo, vice
president of Costa Rica's Sugar Cane Industrial-Agricultural
League. ""At current prices nobody is going to consider
increasing production.""
    Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing
output, given the instability of world markets.
    An official at Colombia's National Association of Sugar
Cane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets.
""The market is very unstable. What is happening is not yet
giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify
anything.""
    In 1985, the latest year for which full figures are
available, Central and South American nations produced 28 mln
tonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. A
year earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000
more, according to the London-based International Sugar
Organization.
    Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar
industry in many countries in the region into a recession from
which it will be hard to recover.
    Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic's
National Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boost
production even if prices recovered sharply.
    Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from
900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transport
and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short
term recovery in output, he added.
    Plans of nearby Cuba, the world's largest cane sugar
exporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end
of the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output is
running well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970.
    Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problems
and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices,
since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries
under special deals. Last year, bad weather added to its
troubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in
1985.
    The low world prices of recent years have led many
countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels
where they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbean
countries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for which
they receive prices well above free market levels.
    Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led to
production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to
the free world market.
    Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. In
both 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this year
its quota is only 37,000.
    A national cooperative official said that, as long as world
market levels continue at around half of Peru's production
cost, the future of the industry is uncertain.
    At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials
stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane
which, according to the group's executive-secretary Eduardo
Latorre, ""grows like a weed"" throughout the region.
    Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240
mln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane in
excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into
sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency.
    The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and Alcohol
Institute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives from
foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year.
    Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the
past year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meant
Brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in
1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments to
next year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking point
being how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of
sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would
cost eight cents to replace.
    Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export
sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, with
the Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of
either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild
depleted reserve stockpiles.
    However, the situation could change dramatically if the
economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps.
    Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little
hope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitability
unless the U.S. And EC change their policies.
    ""The agricultural policies of the European Community and of
the United States have caused our economies incalculable harm
by closing their markets, by price deterioration in
international commerce and furthermore by the unfair
competition in third countries,"" Brazil's Trade and Industry
Minister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA
meeting.
    The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for
what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess
output on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is the
main cause of low prices.
    GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which
would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the
region's industry out of steady decline. Such an agreement
would have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialised
countries would have to see it as a political rather than a
merely economic pact.
    ""They have to realise that the more our economies suffer,
the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the
region's 360 billion dollar foreign debt,"" GEPLACEA's Latorre
said.

<title>CZARNIKOW EXPECTS LOWER EUROPEAN SUGAR OUTPUT</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 19 - </dateline>European sugar output on the basis of

<title>CUBAN SUGAR OUTPUT SEEN AT 7.5 MLN TONNES</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 19 - </dateline>Cuban sugar output this season (1986/87)
is put at around 7.5 mln tonnes raw value by broker C.Czarnikow
in its monthly sugar market review.
    Allowing for around 700,000 tonnes for the current year's
domestic usage it would leave around 6.8 mln tonnes for export
of which, Czarnikow estimates, about 3.7 mln tonnes will be
taken by the USSR, 1.530 mln by other socialist countries and
the remainder for delivery to non-socialist bloc destinations.
    Czarnikow also estimated USSR 1986/87 production at 8.75
mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 3.7 mln imports
from Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and export
needs of 14.2 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 1.75 mln tonnes to
be acquired from the world market. Soviet purchases to date may
not be far short of that quantity, Czarnikow said.

<title>EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN AS CONCESSION TO PRODUCERS</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, March 19 - </dateline>The rebate granted at yesterday's EC
sugar tender represents some concession to producers'
complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the
bloc, EC Commission officials said.
    The maximum rebate of 44.819 European currency units (Ecus)
per 100 kilos was 1.3 Ecus below what producers say is needed
to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into
intervention.
    The rebate at last week's tender was 2.5 Ecus per 100 kilos
short of the level producers said was needed, the officials
said.
    The officials said the Commission is not negotiating with
producers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar
for sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade
it to offer higher rebates.
    They said the French and German producers involved are now
unable to withdraw this offer before April 1 when the sugar
will officially enter intervention stores.
    Payment for it is due five weeks later, and it will be open
to them to withdraw their offers at any time between April 1
and the official payment date when the Commission officially
takes ownership of the sugar, the officials said.
    The officials said if the Commission has to buy the sugar,
it is determined to immediately resell it, a move which would
drive down market prices further.
    They expressed some hope that the operators would not
eventually go through with their plan for intervention sales.
    ""We think they realise they have gone too far,"" one official
said.

<title>EC MAY OFFER INTERVENTION SUGAR TO LOCAL MARKET</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 19 - </dateline>Sugar which EC producers plan to sell
into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for
sale within the Community, broker C. Czarnikow says in its
latest sugar review.
    The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very
nominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to the
intervention price, with detrimental consequences for
producers' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as an
attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered
sugar.
    The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade
producers from their chosen course, such as removing the time
limit on storage contracts, which presently means that
intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September,
Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of production
quotas being reduced.
    If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for
export, the restitutions would have to be higher than those at
recent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the difference
between the EC price and the world market price, the extra
costs might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says.
    The producers might have to repay these costs through
production levies and the proposed special elimination levy,
Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costs
could be recovered under EC rules.
    The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes of
sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the
EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to
bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price,
Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form of
protest designed to force the Commission's hand.
    In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered for
intervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure
that the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in
1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price,
West German producers face a further price reduction in July
with a probable revaluation of the ""green"" mark.
    Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem is
not expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared to
traders for some years that the EC's export policy is
insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, it
says.
    The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by
increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, Czarnikow says,
suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut
down the amount of ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" surrounding the
export tender system.

<title>INTERNATIONAL SUGAR PACT TO BE RENEGOTIATED</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 19 - </dateline>The International Sugar Agreement (ISA)
will be renegotiated, International Sugar Organization (ISO)
officer in charge Constantin Politoff told Reuters after a
special session of the pact's council.
    A decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the ISO
six monthly session in May. The alternatives are between an
autumn London conference for another pact without economic
clauses, but a different voting and budgetary structure, or a
Geneva-based conference next year for a new pact with economic
clauses, he said.
    But delegates said the latter would only be considered if
the world's four major exporters -- Australia, Brazil, Cuba and
the European Community -- can resolve differences over how
prices can best be supported and how to share the world
    Today's special session was called because the U.S. earlier
indicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share of
the ISO budget.
    At today's council session Politoff said the U.S. would try
and find a way to pay the balance of about 50,000 stg later
this year. Currently, about three quarters of this year's ISO
800,000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said the
U.S. caused controversy as it said it might not pay its full
contribution in the last year of the current pact.
    The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISO
budget is shared out. Currently it is halved between importers
and exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of the
importer half. The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only a
single category of members who would all share the costs pro
rata to their share of world sugar trade.
    The ISO executive committee next meets on April 23 with the
next full council session in the week of May 19.
    There are 12 importing and 44 exporting members of the ISO.

<title>U.S. SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 20 - </dateline>The U.S. Agriculture Department 
formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to
drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers
for the cut with targeted income payments.
    In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying
the ""Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987"", Peter Myers,
Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration
wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning
with the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.
    Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the
government for the price support cut with targeted income
payments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would
cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.
    The administration sugar proposal is expected to be
introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.
John Porter, R-Ill.
    Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it
is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because
politically-influential sugar and corn growers
and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.
    The direct payment plan outlined by the administration 
targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually
lowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment
any output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.
    For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower
would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3
cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.
    The income payments would be based on the amount of
commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985
or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.
    Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes
in the sugar program because the current high price support is
causing adverse trends in the sugar industry.
    He said the current program has artificially stimulated
domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed
corn sweeteners to make market inroads.
    U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a
""progressive contraction"" of the sugar import quota to only one
mln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar
refiners who rely on imported sugar processing.
    Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives
overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a
competitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of
sugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing
facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.
    USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on
U.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said
consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than
necessary for sugar.
    ""Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between
sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse
impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently
facing,"" Myers said.
    The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts per
lb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tons
recoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal to
compensate sugar growers with targeted payments.

<title>BEGHIN-SAY SEES SOLUTION TO EC SUGAR DISPUTE</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, March 23 - </dateline>A settlement could soon be reached in the
dispute between European sugar producers and the European
Community over EC export licencing policies, Jean-Marc Vernes,
president of French sugar producer Beghin-Say, which is leading
the protest, told journalists today.
    ""Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few days
indicate that we are moving towards a solution,"" he said, adding
that if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854,000
tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention.
    Vernes said that the protest, involving 770,000 tonnes of
sugar from French producers alone, was prompted by the EC's
policy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failed
to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain
by offering sugar into EC intervention.
    At last week's tender the EC Commission made an apparent
concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 European
currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producers
say is needed, compared with the previous week's rebate which
was 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level.
    Vernes would not say what form any compromise between the
producers and the EC would take, but he reaffirmed the
long-term desire of producers to export to the world market,
providing they were not losing money by doing so.
    Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April
1, when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores, or
at any time over the following five weeks before the official
payment date.
    The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal
market if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers.

<title>U.S. SUGAR QUOTA MAY BE EASED, CONGRESSMAN SAYS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 24 - </dateline>The United States may soon ease its
1987 sugar import quota of one mln short tons by bringing
forward to the third quarter some shipments scheduled for the
fourth quarter of 1987, Jerry Huckaby, a leading Congressman
representing sugar growers told Reuters in an interview.
    Huckaby, a Louisiana Democrat and chairman of the House
subcommittee which deals with the sugar program, indicated the
easing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern about
the impact of the severe cut in U.S. sugar imports this year.
    ""With imports coming down from 1.8 mln (last year) to one
mln, there is legitimate concern about the impacts on Caribbean
countries and the Philippines,"" Huckaby said.
    By bringing forward to the third quarter some imports, the
quota would effectively be eased by about 250,000 tons.
    Huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the third
quarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the September
to December period ""we could get away without having to
increase the quota.""
    He noted that some in the sugar industry believe an
increase in the quota is justified.
    Earlier this month, representatives of U.S. cane sugar
refiners met with U.S. Agriculture Department officials to
request a quota increase of at least 200,000 tons. The refiners
said the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictive
there could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U.S later
this year, a refiner spokesman said.
    However, the official slaid the USDA replied only that it
would consider the request.
    Following the refiners' request, representatives of the
Florida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express opposition
to any quota expansion, industry sources said.
    The statement by Huckaby, who as a representative from a
sugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect of
the current sugar program, indicates at least some grower
officials are concerned enough to support an easing of the
import quota, industry officials said.
    Any final decision on easing the quota must be made by the
Reagan administration's interagency sugar policy group.
    Asked about possible quota changes, A USDA official said
""As far as I know, changing the quota volume or the quota year
is not under active consideration.""

<title>JAPAN'S 1986/87 SUGAR CANE OUTPUT SEEN FALLING</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 25 - </dateline>An Agriculture Ministry survey has
estimated the nation's 1986/87 crop sugar cane output at 2.14
mln tonnes, down from 2.62 mln a year earlier.
    Ministry officials said the decline was due to bad weather
and a reduction in the land under sugar cane this season, which
totals 34,800 hectares, down from 35,700 in 1985/86, they said.
    Harvesting stretches from December 1986 to April 1987

<title>SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT TO STOP IMPORTING SUGAR</title>
<dateline>    COLOMBO, March 25 - </dateline>The Food Department will no longer
import sugar from April 1, senior officials of the Food and
Cooperatives Ministry and the Department told Reuters.
    They said the decision was taken after the Sugar Importers
Association asked that the sugar trade be further liberalised.
    ""The Food Department will cease trading in sugar and will no
longer hold a buffer stock,"" a senior official said.
    He said the government has finalised an agreement with
E.D.F.Man (Sugar) Ltd under which E.D.F.Man will hold a buffer
stock on the government's behalf of 20,000 tonnes, against the
45,000 tonne buffer stock usually held by the Department.
    Officials said the size of the buffer stock has been
reduced because the private sector will hold its own stocks.
    The agreement with E.D.F. Man includes details such as
trigger pricing mechanisms, they said.
    Four months ago the Department allowed the private sector
to import sugar without government clearance. The Department
and the private sector each imported around 115,000 tonnes of
sugar last year, when national consumption was 280,000 tonnes.
    An Importers Association official said that ""even if the
Department no longer imports sugar, we would not necessarily
buy more.""
    This is because the Association would still have to compete
with the Cooperatives Wholesale Establishment (CWE), he said.
    The CWE is a semi-government body and the official said
arrangements are being made for state cooperatives and holders
of food subsidy stamps to draw their sugar from it, starting
April 1.
    Ministry officials said the CWE can either import sugar or
buy it from a local bonded warehousing scheme run by E.D.F. For
the past two years.

<title>UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDS EC SUGAR TENDER RESULT-TRADE</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 25 - </dateline>Considerable uncertainty surrounds the
outcome of today's EC white sugar tender, traders here said,
noting it remains overshadowed by European operator threats to
move over 800,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention.
    They said that due to the dispute between the Commission
and producers over the issue, it is not clear whether the
Commission will authorise any exports at all or grant licences
on a large tonnage.
    The subsidy is seen being set above 45.00 Ecus per 100
kilos, although traders are reluctant to predict a precise
level after prices fell yesterday.
    Earlier, traders in Paris said they expected the Commission
to award licences for around 50,000 tonnes of white sugar with
a maximum export rebate of 45.75 to 46.0 Ecus.
    Last week, the Commission granted licences to end August on
60,500 tonnes of whites at a maximum rebate of 44.819.

<title>U.S. SUGAR POLICY MAY SELF-DESTRUCT, CONGRESSMAN</title>
<author>    By Greg McCune, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </dateline>A leading U.S. farm-state
Congressman, Jerry Huckaby, D-La., warned he will press next
year for legislation to control domestic production of
sweeteners, perhaps including corn sweeteners, if the industry
fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year.
    ""We're moving toward a direction where we could
self-destruct (the U.S. sugar program),"" Rep. Huckaby, chairman
of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar
issues, told Reuters in an interview.
    Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year
they must halt production increases, said he will deliver the
same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He also
said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.
    Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic
sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further
cuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.
    ""I think if we're talking about dropping (the quota)
another half mln tons, lets say, you're getting to the point
where the program might not work,"" he said.
    ""Ideally, I'd like to freeze things right where we are,""
said Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress.
    A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the
current level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the
U.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar imports
holding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said.
    A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made
until 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.
    ""I feel like if we didn't expand production, we could
probably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through
the 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),""
Huckaby said.
    However, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup
producers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetener
market from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said.
    He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will
capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in
the U.S.
    But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the
production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further
expanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar imports
might be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced.
    Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner
companies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon.
    ""This program is advantageous to the corn users. They have
some natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the
program is preserved,"" Huckaby said.
    Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to
think about how domestic output could be controlled, either
through production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.
    Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the
Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask
corn refiners to limit production.
    ""I don't know if we will go this route, but if we do
there's a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do
that legally?"" he said.
    Asked if he would proceed with production controls without
the support of corn refiners, Huckaby said ""You build a fragile
house if you do it that way.""
    Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmers
have expanded production, because high sugar price support
means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such
as soybeans and grain.
    But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would
not be good policy.
    Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to
sugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they
may be penalized retroactively under any production control
legislation passed next year.
    Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in
the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration
proposal to drastically slash the program.
    ""The administration proposal is so drastic, that I don't
think it will get up a head of steam,"" Huckaby said.
    He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price
support is unlikely to be approved.
    Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program,
Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint
with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the
European Community's sugar policy. He said EC policies are the
major cause of the depressed world sugar market.

<title>EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN AS FURTHER CONCESSION</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, March 26 - </dateline>The rebates granted at yesterday's EC
sugar tender represent a further concession to producers'
complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the
bloc, trade sources said.
    They said the maximum rebate of 45.678 European currency
Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos was 0.87 Ecus below what producers
claim is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered
for sales into intervention.
    The rebate at last week's tender was 1.3 Ecus short of the
level producers thought necessary and that of the previous week
was 2.5 Ecus below this level.
    But the sources said producers who have offered a total of
854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparent
attempt to persuade the Commission to set higher maximum
rebates have given no formal indication to the Commission that
they intend to withdraw these offers.
    The French and German operators involved would be able to
withdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when the
sugar will officially enter intervention stores.
    The five-week period is the normal delay between sugar
going into intervention and payment being made for it.
    EC officials have said that if the Commission has to buy
the sugar, it is determined immediately to resell it, a move
which could drive down market prices further.

<title>PHILIPPINES TO LOBBY U.S. FOR HIGHER SUGAR QUOTA</title>

<title>PHILIPPINE SUGAR CROP SET AT 1.6 MLN TONNES</title>
<author>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    MANILA, March 27 - </dateline>Philippine sugar production in the
1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes,
up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, Sugar
Regulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said.
    Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current milling
season, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimate
would almost certainly be met.
    He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop would
be earmarked for domestic consumption.
    Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for the
U.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and
50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market.
    He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA
recommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would take
up another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target.
    ""The government, for its own reasons, has been delaying
approval of the project, but we expect it to come through by
July,"" Yulo said.
    Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oil
import bill by about 300 mln pesos.
    Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to
start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved.
    The ethanol project would result in employment for about
100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work by
depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry.
    Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, had
been submitted to President Corazon Aquino.
    ""I think the President would rather wait till the new
Congress convenes after the May elections,"" he said. ""But there
is really no need for such quotas. We are right now producing
just slightly over our own consumption level.""
    ""The producers have never enjoyed such high prices,"" Yulo
said, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos
per picul, up from 190 pesos last August.
    Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation
following the SRA's bid to control production.
    ""We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,""
he said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned from
their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and
cloth production.
    He said diversification into products other than ethanol
was also possible within the sugar industry.
    ""The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons,"" Yulo said.
""They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but they
relocated many of them and diversified production. We want to
call this a 'sugarcane industry' instead of the sugar industry.""
    He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, used
for thatching roofs, or used in room panelling.
    ""When you cut sugarcane you don't even have to produce
sugar,"" he said.
    Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the
International Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984.
    ""As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new
agreement which would revive world prices,"" Yulo said.
    ""If there is no agreement world prices will always be
depressed, particularly because the European Community is
subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets.""
    He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60
cents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, where
production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound.
    ""If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents I
expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end
of this year,"" he said.
    Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by
1990, with world consumption outstripping production.
    He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments
from artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup.
    ""But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration,"" he
said. ""Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the
U.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cut
ours in half without any justification.""
    Manila was keenly watching Washington's moves to cut
domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents.
    The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its
12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to
143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986.
    Yulo said despite next year's increased production target,
some Philippine mills were expected to shut down.
    ""At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the
1986/87 season,"" he said. ""We expect two or three more to follow
suit during the next season.""

<title>SUGAR MARKET SEES GOOD RECENT OFFTAKE</title>
<author>    By Peter Read</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 27 - </dateline>Reports the Soviet Union has lately
extended its recent buying programme by taking five to eight
raws cargoes from the free market at around 30/40 points under
New York May futures highlight recent worldwide demand for
sugar for a variety of destinations, traders said.
    The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India,
Turkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China.
    Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands in
current activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade which
previously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added.
    Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the Soviet
Union in the past few days involved Japanese operators selling
Thai origin sugar.
    Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightened
considerably recently due to good Far Eastern demand, possibly
for sales to the Soviet Union or to pre-empt any large block
enquiries by China, they said.
    Thai prices for March/May 15 shipments have hardened to
around 13/14 points under May New York from larger discounts
previously, they added.
    Traders said the Soviet Union might be looking to buy more
sugar in the near term, possibly towards an overall requirement
this year of around two mln tonnes. It is probable that some
1.8 mln tonnes have already been taken up, they said.
    Turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100,000
tonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases of
two to three cargoes for Mar/Apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne cost
and freight and could be seeking more. Libya was also a buyer
this week, taking two cargoes of whites which, for an
undisclosed shipment period, were reported priced around
229/230 dlrs a tonne cost and freight, they added.
    Futures prices reacted upwards to the news of end-buyer
physicals offtake, although much of the enquiry emerged
recently when prices took an interim technical dip, traders
said.
    Pakistan is lined up shortly to buy 100,000 tonnes of
whites although traders said the tender, originally scheduled
for tomorrow, might not take place until a week later.
    Egypt will be seeking 20,000 tonnes of May arrival white
sugar next week, while Greece has called an internal EC tender
for 40,000 tonnes of whites to be held in early April, for
arrival in four equal parts in May, June, July and August.

<title>AUSTRALIAN SUGAR AREAS SAID RECEIVING SOME RAIN</title>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, March 30 - </dateline>Dry areas of the Australian sugar cane
belt along the Queensland coast have been receiving just enough
rain to sustain the 1987 crop, an Australian Sugar Producers
Association spokesman said.
    The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago, but
rainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are
needed in some areas, notably in the Burdekin and Mackay
regions, he said from Brisbane.
    Elsewhere, in the far north and the far south of the state
and in northern New South Wales, the cane crop is looking very
good after heavy falls this month, he said.
    The spokesman said it is still too early to tell what
effect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop, which
is harvested from around June to December.
    He said frequent but light falls in the areas that are
short of moisture, such as Mackay, mean they really only need
about three days of the region's heavy tropical rains to
restore normal moisture to the cane.
    But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial
to the size of the crop in the dry areas, he said.
    ""It's certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but it
might be in a month without some good falls,"" he said.

<title>U.S. SUGARBEET PLANTINGS SEEN RISING IN 1987</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 31 - </dateline>Representatives of U.S. sugar grower
organizations said they expect some increase the area planted
to sugarbeets this year and said the prospects for the 1987
cane sugar crop also are good.
    Dave Carter, president of the U.S. beet sugar association,
said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states,
California and Michigan, while sowings could be down slightly
in the largest producing state of Minnesota.
    Overall, Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in the
midwest, and this coupled with increases in California would
increase U.S. sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1.232 mln
acres sown last year.
    USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U.S.
sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report.
    The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowings
is that returns from competing crops such as soybeans and
grains are ""just awful,"" said Carter.
    In the midwest, bankers are strongly encouraging farmers to
plant sugarbeets because the U.S. sugar program offers a loan
rate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers from
beet processors are spread evenly over the growing season, said
Luther Markwart, executive vice president of the American
sugarbeet growers association.
    ""The banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys,""
Markwart said.
    In some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking a
contract with processors to plant beets, Markwart said.
    USDA's report today will not include any harvested area
estimates for sugarcane, but representatives of Florida, Hawaii
and Louisiana growers said crop prospects are good.
    Horis Godfrey, a consultant representing Florida and Texas
cane growers, said Florida cane is off to a good start  because
for the first time in several years there was no winter freeze.
Although area to be harvesteed is about the same as last year,
cane production may be up in Florida this year, he said.
    In Hawaii, area harvested may decline slightly this year,
but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields,
said Eiler Ravnholt, vice president of the Hawaiian Sugar
Planters Association.
    The acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more than
the usual amount of attention this year because of mounting
concern that continued increases in domestic sugar production
threaten the U.S. sugar program, industry sources said.
    The increases in beet plantings have especially caused
concern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings,
particularly in Hawaii, industry officials said.
    ""We haven't had a good weather year throughout the beet and
cane areas in more than five years,"" said Godfrey, adding that
the U.S. may be due for a good weather year.
    Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., chairman of the House
agriculture subcommittee responsible for the sugar program, has
threatened to offer legislation next year to curb domestic
sweetener output if growers fail to restrain output in 1987.

<title>BEGHIN-SAY SAYS SUGAR OFFER TO EC STILL STANDS</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, March 31 - </dateline>A plan by European producers to sell
854,000 tonnes of sugar to European Community intervention
stocks still stands, Andrea Minguzzi, an official at French
sugar producer Beghin-Say, said.
    Last week Beghin-Say president Jean-Marc Vernes said a
possible settlement of a row with the EC would lead producers
to withdraw their offer, which was made as a protest against EC
export licensing policies.
    The EC policy is to offer export rebates, which fail to
give producers an equivalent price to that which they would get
by offering sugar into intervention stocks, Vernes said.
    But Minguzzi said the offer was a commercial affair and
that producers had no intention of withdrawing the sugar offer
already lodged with intervention boards of different European
countries. He said final quality approval for all the sugar
offered could come later this week. Some 95 pct had already
cleared quality specifications.
    The EC can only reject an offer to sell into intervention
stocks on quality grounds. Minguzzi added that under EC
regulations, the Community has until early May to pay for the
sugar. He declined to put an exact figure on the amount of
sugar offered by Beghin-Say, but said it was below 500,000
tonnes.

<title>EC SUGAR TENDER SAID TO MARK NO CHANGE IN POLICY</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, April 2 - </dateline>The maximum rebate granted at
yesterday's European Community (EC) sugar tender marked no
change in policy towards producers' complaints that they are
losing money on exports outside the EC, EC commission sources
said.
    They said this was despite the fact that the commission
accepted over 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention
yesterday from traders protesting that rebates are being set
too low.
    The maximum rebate at yesterday's tender was 46.864 Ecus
per 100 kilos, up from 45.678 Ecus the previous week.
    London traders said yesterday the rebate was the largest
ever granted. The commission sources said today the increase
was entirely explained by world market conditions. The amount
by which the rebate fell short of what producers claim is
needed to obtain an equivalent price to that for sales into
intervention remained at 0.87 Ecus per 100 kilos, they said.
    Operators offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar into
intervention last month to protest at rebates which they said
were too low. The sources said about 706,470 tonnes of French
sugar and 79,000 tonnes of German sugar had been accepted, the
remainder being rejected as of too low quality.
    The sources noted the operators could withdraw their offers
in the five week period between the acceptance of the sugar and
payment for it.
    They said they saw no sign of planned withdrawals as yet,
adding that they would expect operators to wait another week or
two to review commission policy before making up their minds.
    The sources said the commission felt entitled to offer
rebates at slightly below the level theoretically justifiable
in the light of its 1987/88 farm price package proposal to
reduce guaranteed prices for sugar by two pct from the start of
the new season in July.

<title>RECENT SUGAR FALL SPARKS SOVIET, CHINESE BUYING</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 3 - </dateline>The recent fall in world sugar prices,
due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export
availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China
and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said.
    Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of
China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should
limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly
market report.
   ""And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return
to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for
May/June shipment, Man added.
    The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May
shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total
purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said.
    Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln
tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5
mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being
countered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3
mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier.
    Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could
be close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar
production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down.
    Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks
in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to
boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not
be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates
Cuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln
tonnes.
    However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters
with reduced availability, Man said.
    Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen
to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free
market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which
has left exporters chasing falling import requirements.
    A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the
difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still
remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is
needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still
overhanging the market, Man said.
    The increasing cases of record production as a result of
record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers
to strive for greater efficiency.
    As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of
production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to
prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said.
    Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and
sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the
level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully
compensate producers when exporting on the world market.
    Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugar
is expected to remain in intervention, it added.

<title>BEGHIN-SAY NOT PLANNING TO WITHDRAW SUGAR</title>
<author>    By Audrey Stuart, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    PARIS, April 3 - </dateline>French sugar producer Beghin-Say is not
currently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed into
intervention, despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded at
this week's European Community (EC) sugar tender, Beghin-Say
President Jean-Marc Vernes told Reuters.
    The maximum rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos on
Wednesday was the largest ever granted, according to traders.
    Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission has
started to move in the right direction, but said his company
had no plans to change its decision to put sugar into
intervention.
    But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a final
agreement would be reached with the commission which would
allow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention.
    European operators offered 854,000 tonnes of sugar into
intervention to protest about export rebates which they say are
too low. Over 785,000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by the
commission on Wednesday, according to commission sources.
    Under EC regulations, however, operators have another four
to five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention before
payment is made for it.
    A total of 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes
of West German sugar has been accepted into intervention, trade
sources said here. This amount represents about a third of
annual EC exports to non-EC countries.
    Beghin-Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it had
offered into intervention, but said it was below 500,000
tonnes.
    Producers say they have been losing 2.5 to 3.0 Ecus on
every 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fully
bridge the gap between EC and world prices. Wednesday's rebate
was 0.87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get an
equivalent price to that for sales into intervention, traders
said.
    Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates to
the full intervention price and said Wednesday's tender was a
step in the right direction.
    Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorised
for export since the begining of the current campaign had been
inadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate.
    Trade sources said new regulations governing export
rebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth the
path for the commission to award larger export rebates in
future.
    One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemed
the commission had understood the protest action and was now
moving towards adapting the situation accordingly, thereby
allowing the operators to withdraw their sugar from
intervention once they got satisfaction.

<title>U.S. IMMIGRATION RULES SPARK CONGRESS OBJECTIONS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </dateline>New immigration rules relating to
alien farm workers and reportedly being drafted by the U.S.
Agriculture Department are meeting with objections in Congress,
sources on Capitol Hill said.
    USDA is drafting regulations, required by a 1986 law, that
would offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in the
cultivation of fruits, vegetables and other perishable
commodities.
    The department is considering including in its definition
of perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco, hops,
Spanish reeds and Christmas trees, while excluding sugar cane,
the New York Times reported yesterday.
    Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., would like to see the
definition extended to include sugar cane, cultivation of which
is ""a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation,""
Gene Smith, a spokesman for Berman, said.
    Livestock, dairy and poultry producers have been lobbying
USDA hard to have their products covered by the amnesty
provision, farm industry sources said.
    Chuck Fields of the American Farm Bureau Federation said
livestock producers were ""desperate"" because they fear they will
be unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joined
that industry.
    A House staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986
immigration law who asked not to be identified said Congress
did not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workers
who helped cultivate tobacco, and that inclusion of hops and
Spanish reeds was ""marginal.""
    In addition, lawmakers made it clear during consideration
of the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by the
the amnesty provisions, making the inclusion of Christmas trees
""a tough call,"" this source said.
    USDA officials declined to comment on the draft regulation
except to say it was subject to change before it will be
released, probably some time later this month.
    While lawmakers may object to the USDA rule under
consideration relating to perishable commodities, Congress is
not likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigration
question, congressional sources said.
    The amnesty provision specially designed for farm workers
was crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill.
    Congressional staff members estimate the special farm
worker amnesty provision would apply to between 250,000 to
350,000 aliens. The law would allow eligible farm workers who
worked for 90 days during the year ending May 1, 1986, to apply
for temporary, then permanent, resident status.

<title>CUBA CRUDE SUGAR HARVEST FAR BEHIND SCHEDULE</title>
<dateline>    HAVANA, April 7 - </dateline>Cuban president Fidel Castro told a
Congress of the Union of Young Communists here that the
production of crude sugar during the harvest still in progress
is 800,000 tonnes behind schedule.
    In a speech Sunday, published in today's official paper
GRANMA, Castro said unseasonable rains since January seriously
interrupted harvesting and milling operations especially in the
central and western parts of the island.
    The Cuban leader said the mechanical cane harvesters
scheduled to cut over 60 pct of the cane this year were
particularly ""vulnerable,"" as muddy fields prevent operations.
    Neither Castro nor the Cuban press have given out figures
to estimate tonnes of crude production during the present
harvest or the goals for the sugar campaign.
    However, a cuban sugar official told Reuters that the
country will be lucky if crude output reaches last year's 7.2
mln tonnes. Output of crude for the previous 1984-85 harvest
was 8.2 mln tonnes.
    The harvest was scheduled to end April 30 but due to the
present shortfalls it will be extended into May and June, the
official said.
