<title>JAPAN EXPECTED TO CUT BASE RATE FOR STATE BODIES</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, Feb 27 - </dateline>Japan is expected to cut the base lending
rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as
part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris,
Finance Ministry sources said.
    They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund
Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3,
abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with
the bureau.
    The bureau channels funds to government financial
institutions for public works and other official uses, they
said.
    The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan
Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance
corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in
tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.
    However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,
to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund
Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.
    The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a
market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the
domestic economy, they said.
    On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut
their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.
The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors
using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and
Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of
the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.
    These ministries are trying to determine which market rates
should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate,
the ministry sources said.
    Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1
percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added.

<title>ITALIAN TREASURY CUTS INTEREST ON CERTIFICATES</title>
<dateline>    ROME, March 1 - </dateline>The Italian treasury said annual coupon
rates payable March 1988 on two issues of long-term treasury
certificates (CCTs) would be cut by about four percentage
points compared with rates this March.
    Coupon rates on 10-year certificates maturing March 1995
will fall to 9.80 pct from 13.65 pct and rates on 10-year
issues maturing in March 1996 would fall to 10.05 pct from
14.30 pct.
    The Treasury also cut by 0.60 point six-monthly coupons
payable this September on six issues maturing between September
1988 and September 1991.
    The issues carry terms of between five and seven years and
will have coupon rates of between 4.85 and 5.65 pct in
September compared with 5.45 and 6.25 pct this March.

<title>JAPAN TO PROMOTE INTEREST RATE LIBERALISATION</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 2 - </dateline>The Bank of Japan decided at a policy
board meeting to promote further interest rate liberalisation
by lowering the minimum denomination of regulation-free large
deposits and by raising the interest rate ceiling on money
market certificates (MMCs), a central bank official said.
    The new guideline will go into effect on April 6, the bank
said.
    Under the guideline, the minimum denomination of
regulation-free large deposits will be lowered to 100 mln yen
from 300 mln.
    The interest rate ceiling of MMCs with maturities of
between one year and two years will be set at 0.5 percentage
point below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate, the
bank said.
    But the ceiling on MMCs with maturities of one year or less
will remain the same, or 0.75 percentage point below the CD
rates.
    The minimum denomination of MMCs will be lowered to 10 mln
yen from 30 mln.
    The bank also said time deposit rates will be lowered by
0.37 point, effective March 16, in line with the half-point cut
in the official discount rate on February 23.
    New interest rates on two-year and one-year deposits at
banks, for example, will be 3.64 pct and 3.39 pct per annum,
respectively.
    Demand deposit rates, however, will remain the same.

<title>NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY</title>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, March 3 - </dateline>The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on
Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have
stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.
    Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's
tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will
be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining
16 billion marks from the system.
    The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival
festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will
close banks here this afternoon.
    Because of the disruption to business from carnival,
minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are
unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their
needs at the tender.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough
liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.
    But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,
the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks
this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.
    ""I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount
a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks,"" one dealer said.
    ""They would then stock it up at the next tender when the
need is clearer,"" he added.
    An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion
marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary
drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.
    Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the
Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just
clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.
    Call money traded today at 3.85/95 pct, up from 3.80/90
yesterday.

<title>FED EXPECTED TO ADD TEMPORARY RESERVES</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </dateline>The Federal Reserve is expected to
enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary
reserves, economists said.
    They expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by
arranging 1.5 to two billion dlrs of customer repurchase
agreements. The Fed may add the reserves directly instead via
System repurchases.
    Federal funds, which averaged 6.18 pct yesterday, opened at

rate is under upward pressure partly from settlement of 8.25

<title>FED DRAFTS CURRENCY, RATE SWAP RISK GAUGE</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </dateline>The Federal Reserve Board voted
unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of
interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort
to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that
takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other
assets.
    Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues
today by the Bank of England.
    The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan.
    The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks
associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange
contracts and similar financial instruments.
    Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines
for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities
that banks would be required to take into account in
calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to
maintain.
    Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans
and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that
would establish a bank's minimum capital needs.
    The additional guidelines proposed today would determine
the amount of capital support required for a bank's current
exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure.
    The current exposure would be measured by the
mark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the
replacement cost.
    Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be
calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical
analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking
regulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the
asset.
    The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance
conflicting needs for precision and simplicity.
    They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the
particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts.
    Board officials said the new gauge could increase the
capital required of the largest money center banks, which are
the principal participants in these types of activities.
    They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the
potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to
compete in world financial markets.
    However, the staff concluded, ""The credit risks inherent in
such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk
profiles of some banking organizations.""
    The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest
participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of
including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs.
    Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange
contracts traded on organized exchanges.
    Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was
not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital
rules.

<title>NEW BANK RULES TOUGHER THAN NEEDED, DEALERS SAY</title>
<author>    By Norma Cohen, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 4 - </dateline>U.S. and U.K. bank regulators are asking
banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion
them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency
swap transactions they carry, swap dealers said.
    After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by
the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers said
that in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside
reserves twice for the same risk.
    Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the
proposals.
    Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially
significant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume
of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled
by Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist, dealers in
eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved
in some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that
about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are
outstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the
International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of
Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association
has no comment and will study the proposals.
    ""What they are proposing is really double counting,"" Patrick
de Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley
and Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be
required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct
per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of
replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default.
    ""The potential risk factors are very large relative to what
we had expected,"" said a director at one U.K. merchant bank.
""What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now --
to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might
have 10 years from now,"" he added.(Adds title first paragraph).
    Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by
the agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a
competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the
costs on to customers.
    Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the
exclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal
Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the
proposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that
Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new
capital rules.
     Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank
regulators recognized the concept of netting, that is,
offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single
counterparty against each other.
    The paper said that regulatory authorities ""recognize that
such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce
credit risk."" Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting
agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it
might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly.
    But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an
airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.
     ""One problem is that there has never been a major default
in the swaps market. So we don't know if any of the swap
arrangements will really stand up in court,"" said one bank
official.

<title>SPAIN DEREGULATES BANK DEPOSIT INTEREST RATES</title>
<dateline>    MADRID, March 5 - </dateline>Spain's Finance Ministry deregulated bank
deposit rates in an effort to raise competition among banks and
bring legislation into line with the European Community (EC), a
ministry spokesman said.
    The measure was published today in the Official State
Gazette. It takes effect tomorrow and lifts restrictions on
rates, now limited to six pct on deposits of up to 180 days.
    The government also enacted a decree cutting to one pct
from 13 pct the proportion of total assets which banks must
lend at favourable rates to industries classified ""of public
interest.""
    Some bankers expect the deregulation of rates to result in
a 20 pct drop in profits this year.

told Reuters in a recent interview the reduction in fixed asset
investments would offset losses from the rate liberalisation.

<title>BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE</title>
<dateline>    MADRID, March 5 - </dateline>Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain's
decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings
banks, saying it reflected the socialist government's
determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation
despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity.
    The central bank last night raised the requirement by one
percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess
liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets.
    Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the
Bank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to
choke off money supply growth.
    ""I think it's a good measure,"" a senior foreign banker said.
""It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates
and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy.""
    ""It shows that the political will is very strong. They know
that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive
and bring down unemployment in the long run,"" he added.
    The head of another foreign bank said that only a month
ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise
in reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of
raising interest rates.
    But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now
-- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money
from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish
exports less competitive.
    The government says industry's competitiveness is also
being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was
way above that of Spain's major trading partners in the
European Community, which it joined a year ago.
    To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is
insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for
clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough
sacrifices.
    Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose
demands essentially involve more government spending, have
become an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.
    Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have
some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the
money market too hard.
    The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key
overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at
today's auction. The rate has been increased nine times since
the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.
    Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in
any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate
banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months.
    The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the
publication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankers
say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and,
inevitably, push lending rates higher.
    A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which
banks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect
tomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month
that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher
interest rates.

<title>BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT</title>
<author>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 5 - </dateline>The Bank of England again fought against
money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate
cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise
in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high.
    It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct
of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued
to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and
the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.
    Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can
stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want
to.
    The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants
rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when
it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to
relieve a money market shortage.
    ""They're really making the discount houses suffer,"" said
Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew.
""Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates.""
    This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by
any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had
inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came
strongly into the pound.
    The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London
close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60
marks, up from 2.8720/50.
    ""If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that
rates could drop before the Budget,"" said Jeremy Hale, economist
at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp.
    Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the
base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.
    However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be
convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating
rather than a result of short-term speculative gains.
    There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said
Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co.
    Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of
a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and
disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to
hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback
for bonds, Fellner said.
    An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most
forecasts say it will be this year.
    Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to
oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.
    However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set
the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.
    The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable
rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.
    Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least
a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term
capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan.
    They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet
than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and
current political upheavals in Washington.
    The Bank may want to see another few points on the
trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. ""But by
then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of
England,"" he added.
    The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting
pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources
said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more
than just marking up by foreign exchange traders.
    Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially
harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that
the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.
    This was above previous estimates of the current account
deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.
    Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would
have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they
were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.
    The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing
banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank
officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this
week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.
If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point
cut, with another half or full point about Budget day.

<title>FRENCH PRIMARY BOND MARKET SHOWS NEW SPARKLE</title>
<author>    By Pierre Suchet, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    PARIS, March 6 - </dateline>The French primary bond market is showing
signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy
and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent
interest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said.
    The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal
to the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, by
announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, which
has stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-day
repurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5.
    The central bank's averaged-out day to day call money rate,
the reference rate for interbank money market operators, which
reached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this
week, dealers noted.
    The Bank of France's ""open market"" policy to regulate the
money markets since December has been based on a floor and
ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and
seven day repurchase rates.
    For the moment the sentiment is of ""wait and see"" on rate
cuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists among
market operators, a dealer for a major French bank said.
    Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond
market, noting that this week's monthly Treasury tap issue of
11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily
absorbed.
    The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12
billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as
much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing
needs for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said.
    Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity
in the primary market at the moment despite competition from
the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange.
    There has been a flood of large bond issues, but with
formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand
- with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - which
have been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees.
    Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d'Aide a l'Equipement
des Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion franc
bond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued
over 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March
9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct.
    Even classic fixed-rate issues, after being neglected since
the end of last year, are finding buyers, one banker said.
    Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms
of imminent operations would be set, with great market interest
focussed on the likely three next issues.
    These will include an expected four to five billion franc
issue for Electricite de France, to be followed by a bond of
around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier, a
subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France, and a
new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de
Refinancement Hypothecaire.

<title>IMF URGES BELGIUM TO MAKE FURTHER SPENDING CUTS</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, March 6 - </dateline>The Belgian government, which
introduced large-scale public spending reductions last year,
has been told by an International Monetary Fund team there is
scope for further cuts in 1988.
    The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions
of the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic
policy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the
weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet.
    The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest
rate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates.
    The team's report to the government praises last year's
spending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spending
by 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy
perform ""better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far in
the 1980s.""
    However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisation
of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much
lower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the
government has set itself for 1989.
    The government's net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of
GNP in 1986.
    The report says ""The most that can be afforded over the next
few years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of
general Government.""
    It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax
system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax
burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the
debt to GNP ratio before this is possible.
    ""Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure
growth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions,
we feel that your position would be stronger if you could
decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988,"" the
report adds.
    The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the
government's determination to keep its currency strong and to
curb inflation.
    It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net
long-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986.
    It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and
an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the
subscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues in
Belgian francs.

<title>BANK OF ENGLAND PRESSURE HOLDS BASE RATES</title>
<author>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 6 - </dateline>This week's Bank of England resistance to
strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in
holding bank base rates at 11 pct.
    But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris
Group of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling
broadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources
said.
    Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing
trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the
Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day.
    Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.
    A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted
a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is
therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.
    Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe
Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the
trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. ""Even after this action
over the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking
distance of that range,"" he said.
    Other analysts agree that the government probably has some
broad target range around this area.
    However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the
pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of
a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.
    ""If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they
are, what's to stop it (going higher),"" said John Cox, executive
director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London
foreign exchange market.
    Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active
selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of
general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped
keep it below 1.60 dlrs.
    The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and
1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.
    But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling
heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it
holds around these levels.
    He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest
rate boat. ""If rates don't come down, the market will say they
ought to have come down and will sell sterling,"" he said.
    Most dealers agree there is a good deal of ""hot money"" being
invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight
or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short
notice.
    However, the authorities will hope that at least a
proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.
    ""The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and
have to jack them back up again,"" said Richard Jeffrey,
economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.
    He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for
sterling, at least in the near term.
    However, most analysts are still looking for a full point
about March 17, Budget Day.
    The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the
Budget, said Temperton.
    The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the
run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current
bullishness in the government bond and currency markets.
    ""Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.
He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate
cut,"" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the
equities arm of Mercury International Group.
    Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the
way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in
the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last
Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.
    This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11
3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest
since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.
    However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months
money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut
as a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates.

<title>POSITIVE OUTLOOK TEMPERED IN U.S. DEBT FUTURES</title>
<author>    By Brad Schade, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, March 6 - </dateline>Higher oil prices and stronger than
expected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S.
interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive
chart outlook, financial analysts said.
    The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment
during February was above market expectations for a rise of
170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond
futures that drove the June contract through key technical
support at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted.
    ""I don't like that fact that we had a close below 101,""
said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 level
in the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month
trading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday
led to bullish forecasts by chartists.
    But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly
charts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday.
    Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32
may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep
losses.
    ""I tend to go along with the double top scenario,"" said
Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico.
    Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the fact
that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has
occurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals.
    Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leiner
remains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should find
support between 100 and 99-16/32 next week.
    The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner's expectation
that the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based on
an improving inflation outlook.
    With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal
Reserve little room to ease monetary policy, ""the inflation
outlook is improving,"" Leiner said, and that should lead to
relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar
prices.
    Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices
remains a concern for the inflation outlook.
    Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were
maintaining production quotas and official prices, and got an
extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from
Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday.
    ""The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon,""
said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer.
    The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely
""media induced,"" Singer said. He noted that even though OPEC
production may be within quotas, ""oil stocks are at
tremendously high levels.""
    Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oil
prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, he
said, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices.

<title>GERMAN GOVERNMENT NEEDS SEEN RAISING BOND YIELDS</title>
<author>    By Alice Ratcliffe, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, March 9 - </dateline>Increased federal government borrowing
needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy
mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds
higher this year, bond market sources say.
    ""At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term
rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly
on foreigners,"" one portfolio manager for a large securities
investment house in Frankfurt said.
    The sources also said the government had already stepped up
its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs.
    Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, the
sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six
pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue.
    This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct
coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct.
    But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract
foreign investors, and the federal government would have to
push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon.
    Sources noted federal government issues had also increased
in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume
only starting last May.
    One finance ministry economist said ""It isn't more. It's
just the size (of each bond) which has increased."" He added
conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly
favourable for raising new debt.
    Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad,
with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors.
    With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however,
foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as
hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish.
    Sources said the government has may have already stepped up
its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks.
    The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in
1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing
through bonds was 26.6 billion.
    The sources said this indicated a move by the government
out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds
through the more acceptable loan stock form.
    Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large
amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including
the government's tax reduction program, would also reduce
income next year. ""The problem here will be the tax reform,"" the
portfolio manager said.
    He added that the government's cut in its top income tax
rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for
the government to reduce borrowings.
    The sources said the government would fall far short of
covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the
tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to
fall back on debt markets in one form or the other.
    The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal
government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen
back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the
issue of fixed-rate medium-term ""Kassenobligation"" notes.
    A finance ministry economist said the government did not
expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a
net 22.3 billion marks this year.
    Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would
probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come
into effect.
    ""I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would
mean government borrowing will increase,"" the manager said.
    Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with
the Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculation
falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier.
    But sources said foreign demand for the new federal
government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the
dollar may now rise against the mark.
    ""The demand wasn't so good,"" a dealer for a German bank in
London said.
    The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the mark
even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds
recently, some dealers said.

<title>POEHL SAYS FURTHER RATE CUT POSSIBLE - SOURCES</title>
<author>    By Allan Saunderson and Antonia Sharpe, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, March 9 - </dateline>Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl
told a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cut
leading interest rates again if the United States makes a
similar move, banking sources said.
    The sources were reporting Poehl's remarks at a symposium
in Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag. Press
representatives were not invited.
    The sources, speaking separately, said Poehl told about 200
bankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rates
would give room for a matching measure in Germany.
    ""It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates,"" said
one banker who attended the symposium.
    A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have no
comment on the reported remarks, made at the private meeting.
    But, according to a second source, who also declined to be
identified, Poehl's comments were seen by bankers present as a
direct pointer to further moves by the central bank to defend
German industry from an additional revaluation of the mark.
    ""He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then the
Bundesbank would also drop them. He said that quite clearly,""
the second source said.
    In reply to questions, Poehl also said the half-point cut
in the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after the
U.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting to
discuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made such
a move in advance, the sources said.
    Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded, by
cuts in German rates, to come to the bargaining table as early
as last September, one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying,
""No, they wouldn't have been. We checked that.""
    The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nations
took place exactly one month after the German cut in rates.
    Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talks
between central banks before and after the G-6 meeting, saying
that financial markets had not fully realised the significance
of the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem further
falls in the value of the dollar, the sources said.
    For the first time all participants at the summit agreed
that a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for all
world economies, including the U.S., Poehl had said.
    The sources said the tone of Poehl's comments boosted
growing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised around
current levels by international central bank cooperation.
    One source said Poehl's remarks also underlined the fact
that the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodative
in monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown in
West Germany's economic growth.
    Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the past
stressed that the German central bank had no direct
responsibility for growth and was solely concerned with
combatting inflation.
    This led, for instance, to the introduction of a tighter
monetary stance from the beginning of December until the
half-point cut in rates in late January.
    The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the current
overshooting of the German monetary target would not directly
respark inflation. The Bundesbank was not obliged to react
immediately whenever such overshooting occurs.
    Latest data for central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's
main measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at
7-1/2 pct in January, outside its three to six pct 1987 target.
    Share prices rose in very active trading today, with
dealers reporting that Poehl's remarks, coupled with a bullish
outlook on stock prices from Deutsche at the same symposium,
brought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels.

<title>U.K. ISSUES ONE BILLION STG BOND TRANCHE</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 9 - </dateline>The Bank of England said it was taking
onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct
Treasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct on
application. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct
and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the
remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the
bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free
of tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated
8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 ""B.""  A further 100 mln stg was
reserved for the National Debt Commissioners.
    The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank's
announcement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08
quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20
minutes after the news.
    Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the
backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates
which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of
sterling's strength.
    The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to
see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon
announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11
pct.
    The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate
cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay
a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March
17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures.
    However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable
climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and
allow a half-point cut.
    Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market
as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early
rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling.
    Most market participants believe that Lawson will now
foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time
of the budget, although one or two said they would not be
surprised to see a full point decline at this stage.
    Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts
last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued
a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the
Government bond market.
    To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold
out within hours of becoming available for trading and the
market pushed on to register further sharp gains.
    Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the
issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as
rapidly as last week's.
    However, they noted that although sterling had edged down
from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed
on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final
71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300

<title>WORLD BANK TO BRING BORROWING FORWARD THIS YEAR</title>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, March 9 - </dateline>The World Bank intends to bring
borrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because it
expects global interest rates to rise by year end, World Bank
vice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said.
    He told a news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan,
West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows. ""The weight
of opinion is (that in a year from now) there is a higher
probability there will be one pct higher than one pct lower
interest rates,"" he said.
    The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so far
this year because of the expectation of higher interest rates.
    The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at a
level that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where and
how much to borrow, Rotberg said.
    Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years'
anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstanding
debt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years.
    Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market, it
did not intend to launch new financial instruments just for the
sake of innovation, Rotberg said.
    Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding, only some
eight billion had been swapped into another currency.
    Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors or
unfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was confident that
this was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments.
    The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed over
the next year with methods used before, Rotberg said. However,
for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out new
instruments such as bonds with warrants.
    The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germany
since the first issue was launched in 1959, he said.

<title>PRIMARY EUROSTERLING MARKET BOOMS DESPITE RATE CUT</title>
<author>    By Dominique Jackson, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 9 - </dateline>Two new eurosterling bonds were launched
today, making a total of 10 new deals in the sector so far this
month, as borrowers rush to cash in on a bull sterling market
fueled by the strength of the pound and pre-budget euphoria.
    The Bank of England finally gave way to a 1/2 point cut in
banks' base lending rates earlier today, but dealers said this
had been largely discounted and was not likely to detract from
the current popularity of sterling-denominated investments.
    ""Sterling, in any shape or form, is flavor of the month and
we're set to see many more eurosterling deals,"" one dealer said.
    Today's new eurosterling bonds were a 10-year, 100 mln stg
deal for Sweden at 9-1/2 pct and priced at 101-1/4 pct, lead by
Baring Brothers and Co Ltd and a 14 year 60 mln stg convertible
deal for Storehouse Plc launched by SBCI International Ltd. ""We
thought we saw a proverbial flood of new deals with the 14 we
had last month but it seems March will beat February hands down
with 10 already,"" one eurosterling specialist said.
    ""Optically, psychologically, these single figures are much
more attractive for the borrower. Eurosterling looks like a
cheap and attractive way to raise your money,"" he added.
    This accounts for the wide variety of borrowers who have
tapped the sector recently, ranging from sovereigns such as the
Kingdom of Sweden today, continental banks including
Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank and British corporations.
    Another U.K. Merchant bank analyst noted that the current
vogue for eurosterling enabled several corporate borrowers last
month to offer paper priced below comparative gilt yields.
    A Storehouse official confirmed that the issue was aimed at
Swiss and German investors who were showing good interest.
    This is the first entry into the long term international
capital markets by Storehouse, British designer Terence
Conran's retail conglomerate which incorporates U.K. Chain
stores Mothercare, British Home Stores and Habitat.
    ""We have been considering the move for quite some time now
and the current strength of the eurosterling sector provided
the perfect opportunity and spur for us to finally tap the
market,"" Lance Moir, corporate treasurer at Storehouse Plc told
Reuters.

<title>INDONESIAN BANKS RAISE INTEREST RATES</title>
<author>    By Bill Tarrant, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, March 11 - </dateline>A tight money market has pushed
interest rates on three to six month time deposits to between
15 and 18 pct from 13 to 15 pct a month ago, bankers said.
    March is usually a tight month for the money market because
of tax payments and banks' need to attract funds for their
year-end accounts on March 31.
    This year the situation has been made worse by December's
rush to buy dollars by companies and businessmen who feared
imposition of exchange controls. Much of that outflow has yet
to be converted back into rupiah.
    ""A lot of small money has come back in, but the big money is
holding out until after April,"" one U.S. Banker said.
    The tight money policy of Bank Indonesia, the central bank,
is helping to keep rates high.
    Short-term lending rates now average 25 pct a year, with no
prospect they will be lowered soon, the bankers said.
    Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar said earlier this week
that Indonesia could look forward to better economic prospects
in 1987/88, but added the ""speculators"" who led a run on the
rupiah late last year could again pose problems.
    Indonesia holds general elections on April 23, the first in
five years, and most businessmen expect no new government
economic packages or incentives before then.
    ""Some people are nervous about what the government will do
after the election,"" one banker said. ""They normally try to do
things before the IGGI (Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia)
meeting (in June) to prove they are doing something about the
economy to show they deserve a couple of billion dollars.""
    The IGGI, which groups 14 industrialised donor countries
and four agencies, gave Indonesia 2.5 billion dlrs in soft

<title>U.S. URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN</title>
<author>    By PETER TORDAY, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 11 - </dateline>The U.S. is urging reluctant
commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel
Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes
the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt
strategy, a Reagan administration official said.
    The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleas
for interest rate concessions should be treated much more
seriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing
nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms.
    In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to
reconsider the idea of a ""megabank,"" where Third World debt would
be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such
a plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the
same time, however, the official expressed reservations that
such a scheme would ever get off the ground.
    The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine
suggestions that ""exit bonds"" be issued to end the troublesome
role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to
underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan,
the official said in an interview with Reuters.
    ""All of these things would fit within the definition of our
initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and
unique approach such as those should be considered,"" said the
official, who asked not to be named.
    In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy
under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such
as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations.
    In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact
economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth.
    ""The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors
have been performing well,"" said the official. But he admitted
that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an
exception.
    The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S.
Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker,
also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve
their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis.
    ""We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications
to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more
effectively,"" the official said.
    Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that
commercial banks create a ""megabank"" which could swap Third World
debt paper for so-called ""exit bonds"" for banks like regional
American or European institutions.
    Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to
lend money to their former debtors every time a new money
package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in
its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs.
    He emphasised that the ""megabank"" was not an administration
plan but ""something some people have suggested.""
    Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are
examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third
World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would
differ slightly from the one the official described.
    But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan
would work in the United States.
    ""If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go,
fine. I don't think they ever will.""
    He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World
loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant
to provide new money to debtors through the new institution.
    Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under
which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no
more than 5/8 pct above Libor.
    ""The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite
unique and I don't think it's something that should be
categorically rejected out of hand,"" the official said.
    Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be
offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin
above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment
Notes.
    These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a
six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before
maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point
over Libor.
    Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too
low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at
stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and
granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled
debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support
in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last
year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt.
    But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate
capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the
banks. ""It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you
have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed
before,"" the official said in comments suggesting some ought to
be granted the rate concessions they seek. ""Some people argue
that (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it really
is is narrowing the spread on new money,"" he added.
    He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an
initiative to include plans like the Philippines'.

    Repayments on the debt will be stretched out over 12 years

London Interbank Offered Rate, Libor. The margin on previously
restructured debt also will be cut to 1-1/4 point from 2-1/2.

<title>BRAZIL'S GROS TO MEET BANKS ON TRADE LINE ISSUE</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 11 - </dateline>Brazil's central bank governor
Francisco Gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today
in a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country's
unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs
of foreign commercial bank debt, bankers said.
    Gros will meet representatives of Citibank, the head of
Brazil's bank advisory committee, and of co-heads Morgan
Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc.
    High on the agenda will be banks' complaints about Brazil's
accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade
and interbank lines, the bankers said.
    Brazil's several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed
last March to extend the credit lines until March 31, 1987, as
part of a 31 billion dlr financing package.
    Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupled
with Brazil's freeze, raised a spate of technical and legal
questions that the banks want to discuss with Gros.
    They said they face problems because of the freeze
requirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bank
under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the
central bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switch
their credit lines from one borrower to another.
    The requirement to deposit with the central bank has also
meant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower
interest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would rather
accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the
central bank.
    ""It's caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community,""
one banker said.
    Gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of
a 10-day tour of Europe and Japan that he and finance minister
Dilson Funaro have just completed to seek official support for

<title>NATIONAL SAVINGS MOVE POINTS TO LOWER U.K. RATES</title>
<author>    By Geert Linnebank, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 11 - </dateline>U.K. Interest rates look set to move
lower even after Monday's half-point cut in bank base rates to
10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension of
a British National Savings issue yesterday.
    The Department of National Savings, effectively a Treasury
Department unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launched
in October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-year
private investments between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman said
the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national
savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the
market.
    The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutes
today of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, the
second such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted.
    They said the near-instant sale of the entire new gilts
issue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pct
downpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rates
had to drop sooner rather than later.
    The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due
1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downward
pressure on money market rates remained intact, with the
bellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at
10-9-7/8 pct.
     It coincided with another strong sterling rally which
pushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar.
    ""That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed,"" said
Stephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokers
Phillips and Drew; ""It is an indication that the market believes
rates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-point
immediately after the budget (on March 17), and some people
hope for more.""
    Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by the
National Savings Department was ""of considerable significance.""
    It said, ""the real message ... Is that the decks are being
quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the
building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut
in bank base rates to 10 pct materialises.""
    Building societies have said a drop in bank base rates
would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a
reduction in mortgage lending rates.
    Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed the
National Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasury
policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut.
    ""National Savings has been competing too effectively with
the building societies of late. Building society income has
been depressed in recent months,"" he said.
    He and other analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid
on U.K. Inflation.
    Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britain
than in most other Western economies with inflation seen rising
well above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after
last year's 3.7 pct.
    Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer
prices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rates
would reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct.
    But Lewis and others noted that building societies had been
complaining to the government about intense competition from
National Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for early
mortgage rate cuts.
    ""The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBR
funding from National Savings, but he must be taking the
building societies' criticism to heart. It looks like the
National Savings move reflects this,"" one senior dealer said.
    A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on this
interpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely a
reaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which had
pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with
the rest of the market.
    ""We are not politically motivated ... Funding was just
becoming too expensive and we don't need all that money,"" he
told Reuters, adding the department had suspended issues at
least twice in the past, when offered interest rates were above
or below market rates.
    He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as
U.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline and
income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion
stg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31.
    In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Saving's
contribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg,
compared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of the
previous year, official figures show.
    Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show a
further increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing the
total for 11 months above target, government officials said.

<title>U.K. BANKS OFFER FIXED-RATE MORTGAGES AT 10.2 PCT</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 11 - </dateline>Two major U.K. Clearing banks announced
they will offer a total of 800 mln stg in new mortgages at a
fixed interest rate of 10.2 pct for the first three years,
below current bank base lending rates of 10.5 pct.
    Midland Bank Plc &lt;MDBL.L&gt; said it has initially allocated
500 mln stg for home loans at this rate, while Lloyds Bank Plc
&lt;LLOY.L&gt; will offer 300 mln stg.
    Earlier this week, Midland said it would cut its standard
rate of mortgage payment to 11.5 pct from April 1, following a
half a percentage point reduction in leading banks' base
lending rates from 11 pct.
    Building society and other bank mortgage rates are largely
still well above the new base rate level, although last year
Lloyds offered a fixed rate of 9.9 pct on certain home loans.
    A Midland spokesman said his bank calculated that at the
current level of 2.7 billion stg, its existing mortgage book
accounts for about 5 pct of the total British home loan market.
    Lloyds said it has 3.6 billion stg in outstanding mortgage
loans, but had not estimated its total market share.

the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break
out of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said.
    Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail

    ""You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds

    Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which
traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a
rise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest
to break below chart support in the June contract failed to
materialize, participants who had sold bond futures early
quickly covered short positions, they said.
    ""Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in
as expected it won't be that bad for the market,"" Sloane said.
    Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector
of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct.
    Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure
below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and
she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up
0.8 to 1.2 pct.
    Industrial production and the producer price index Friday
both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she
added.
    Retail sales ""will tell us whether or not we will be able
to fill the gap,"" Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June
bonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds
closed at 100-4/32 today.
    Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the
federal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said
Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer.
    ""A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the
market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the
market approached the top of the range,"" Singer said.
    In order for bonds to break above the top of the range,
which is just below 102 in the June contract, ""the crude oil
rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,""
Singer said. ""Fed funds are already easing back down toward the
six pct level.""
    The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to
Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally
may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said.
    Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to
ease to 99-6/32 and find support.
    ""I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet.
The jury is still out this week,"" Rozich said.

<title>FED SEEN CONTENT WITH U.S. FEBRUARY ECONOMY</title>
<author>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </dateline>U.S. February reports reflecting slim
gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures
reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue
to follow a stable course of monetary policy, economists said.
    ""If you're the Fed, there's no reason to do anything,"" said
Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc.
    ""There are hints that GNP is picking up. On the inflation
front, all is well,"" he said. ""Money supply is well under
control. It's an absolutely ideal situation.""
    February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightly
less than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected.
This compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January's production
number, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase.
    The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct,
less than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pct
rise in the PPI in January.
    ""The Fed is going to look at this positively,"" said Allan
Leslie of Discount Corporation. ""Certainly inflation is not as
bad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrial
production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants.""
    The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in
February, after a 9.8 pct increase in January.
    ""This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation
is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per
barrel,"" said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ""The
trend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year.""
    In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct
decline in the PPI.
    Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected,
but a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car prices
fell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct.
    Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that
a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both
the financial markets and the Federal Reserve.
    ""The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations
today,"" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International.
    While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier
monetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise this
could necessitate a weaker dollar.
    ""The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air,"" he
said. ""We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with
foreign producers.""
    Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct
in February's PPI. With many electronic goods produced
overseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raising
prices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said.
    If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminish
overseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which might
necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices.
    By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8
pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to
a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value
of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987.
    Slifer said import prices may rise further as
manufacturers' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped
to current levels expire, and new contracts are made that
reflect a weaker dollar.
    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported
manufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the
second half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S.
industrial output.
    ""It's the other side of the lower dollar,"" Wyss said.
""Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive
and they are increasing output.""
    Wyss said that the latest data point to an average
industrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter.
""It's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is
beginning to revive.""
    But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not 
convinced that the February reports portend economic gains. He
said much of the strength came from factors that do not point
to a sustained rise in industrial output.
    Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm
equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in
February business equipment production.
    Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2
pct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy
was produced, not that manufacturing activity gained.
    Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted for
half of the industrial production gain as production of auto
assemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5
million units.
    ""In the first quarter, it looks like automakers are
producing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling at
roughly a seven mln unit rate,"" Roach said. ""The disparity
between output and sales is showing up in inventories.""
    Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. business
inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping
demand in the first quarter of 1987.
    January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gain
since July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the Commerce
Department said. Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, the
largest monthly sales drop on record.
    Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react to
month-to-month changes. ""The Fed has been standing pat for the
last seven months,"" Ramirez said. ""They will continue to stand
pat for at least the next couple of months.""

<title>TRADING RANGE LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN DEBT FUTURES</title>
<author>    By Brad Schade, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, March 13 - </dateline>U.S. economic data due out next week is
unlikely to hold any surprises that will shake U.S. interest
rate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range of
the last 3-1/2 months, financial analysts said.
    ""People don't seem to have any firm conviction about the
current strength of the economy or about the Federal Reserve
doing anything,"" said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Norman
Mains.
    The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading
volume, he noted. ""We've had a decline in activity as recent
economic statistics have not greatly changed people's
viewpoints on interest rates,"" Mains said.
    The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of the
economy, coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange
markets after the Paris initiative has made for ""less than
ebullient market action,"" Mains said.
    He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be in
for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the
top of the trading range.
    ""My view is that the economy remains relatively strong and
market participants will see that current prices are
unjustified,"" Mains said.
    Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also noted
that the market is showing very little momentum and lacks
retail interest. ""All of the movement occurs at the opening,""
afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said.
    Although data during the week was mildly positive for bond
prices, the small rise in February producer prices and downward
revisions in January retail sales and industrial production
were ""not real exciting,"" said Prudential Bache analyst Fred
Leiner.
    ""There is no one factor that will push us through the highs
at this moment,"" Leiner said.
    Next week's revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross national
Product is also likely to be of little interest to the market,
said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan.
Still, forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in the
direction of bond prices over the next month.
    Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is
around three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventories
reflected in the January inventory data Friday, which showed
the largest increase since 1979.
    ""The key question will be not whether there is a large
increase in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase is
sustainable or a one shot deal,"" Kahan said.
    He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNP
stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on
second quarter growth.
    If that is the case, GNP in the second quarter could ease
back to a one to two pct growth rate, Kahan said.

<title>PHILIPPINES SEES 1987 GOVERNMENT REVENUE UP 26 PCT</title>
<dateline>    MANILA, March 16 - </dateline>Philippine government revenue is
expected to rise 26 pct to 99.9 billion pesos this year from
79.1 billion in 1986, Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said.
    In a report to President Corazon Aquino on his department's
performance during the year ended February 28, Ongpin said at
least 15.9 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new tax
reform measures announced last year.
    He said the goal for official development assistance (ODA)
this year is two billion dlrs, adding that aid donors have
committed ODA inflows of 1.7 billion dlrs in 1987, up 30 pct
from 1.3 billion in 1986.
    Ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue base
included a value added tax (VAT) system due to be introduced in
1988. He gave no other details.
    He said treasury bill maturities, interest rate levels and
the volume of government securities sold to the private sector
have improved significantly. ""In particular, short-term prime
interest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985, are now down
to less than 10 pct,"" he said.
    Ongpin said the government's debt-equity scheme, introduced
in August last year, had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worth
of applications, but selective evaluation had resulted in
approvals of only 61.8 mln dlrs at end-February.
    He said his department aims to accelerate its privatisation
program and the sale of non-performing assets owned by
associates of former President Ferdinand Marcos to achieve a
1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would help
finance land reform.
    Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billion
pesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failed
companies will be used to finance the land reform plan.
    Ongpin also said the government would pursue efforts to
obtain 500 mln dlrs in concessional funding for the program
from a World Bank-led consultative group of multilateral and
bilateral aid donors.
    The government has said the land reform plan aims to
distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants.

<title>ANALYSTS SEE EARLY ONE POINT CUT IN U.K. BASE RATE</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 17 - </dateline>British bank base lending rates are
likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this
week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K.
Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in
today's 1987 budget, bank analysts said.
    The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and money
markets had already started to reward.
    Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money
market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget
measures came through, the analysts said.
    Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he
expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow.
    ""This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get
interest rates down,"" he said.
    Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely
discounted such a one point cut, with the key three month
interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, and
it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a
half-point cut now.
    Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he,
too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday,
but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts.
    ""This budget is designed to please both the markets and the
electorate. The implications for interest rates are very
favourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another
such cut before the end of the week,"" Simmonds said.
    Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he
said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut
in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target.
""There is no real need to boost private consumption,"" he said.
    National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said
the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the
likelihood of an early one-point base rate cut.
    Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully,
in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the
sharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point
base rate cut could be implemented.
 But providing the budget small-print was convincing, ""and I
suspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one
point off base rates by the end of this week,"" Kern said.
    Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave
the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates.
This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer
price inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said.
    U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11
pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money
and government bonds (gilts) markets.
    But building societies said they would not cut lending
rates until base rates had fallen by one full point.

<title>ANALYSTS SAY U.K. BUDGET POINTS TO BASE RATE CUTS</title>
<author>    By Simon Cox, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 17 - </dateline>Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced
by analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement.
    A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected
tomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. A
follow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week.
    ""Worthy but boring would probably sum it up,"" Peter Fellner,
U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. ""It was
a very, very prudent fiscal budget.""
    Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a
well-balanced budget within the confines of the government's
philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat.
    Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal
side, but offered nothing new on monetary policy.
    As was widely expected, Lawson split his ""fiscal adjustment""
between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg
from 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to
27 pct.
    The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was
kept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad
Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped.
    Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for
a half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the
authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately.
Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full
one-point cut tomorrow.
    ""The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which
it will have to reverse later,"" Jeffrey said, though he added a
further half-point cut was quite possible in the near future.
    The main worry from today's speech is the outlook for
inflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained
in it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said.
    Holt noted the ""rather loose"" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct
at end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result
from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern.
    ""A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,""
he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of
falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on
inflation.
    The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but
it was ""not a good budget for inflation,"" he said
    Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about
the dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not
too concerned about a revival of inflation.
    Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the
""leading edge"" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were
likely to be extremely cautious on this front.
    He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest
rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any
signs of excessive weakness.
    Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility
of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts.
    Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from
1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets,
which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said.
that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by
the favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast
to be 4.0 billion stg.
    But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any
clear-cut indication about the timing of the general election,
which has to be held before June, 1988.
    Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the
benefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise
duties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately.
    But others said it kept several options open and it was not
possible to deduce too much from it.
    James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent,
Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in
that there would be no ""chickens coming home to roost.""
    Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June
election, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for
a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory.
    Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boost
to the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity.

<title>THAI BANKS WEIGH NEW INTEREST RATE CUT</title>
<author>    By Vithoon Amorn, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    BANGKOK, March 18 - </dateline>Officials of five Thai commercial banks
are expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cutting
interest rates, banking sources said.
    They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spur
domestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity
on the money market.
    Many bankers have been urging an average half percentage
point cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending
rates, they said.
    Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan and
overdraft rates by 0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16
but the move has not substantially increased loan demand, the
sources said.
    Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since early
last year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986. The current
gross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank deposit
and the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade.
    Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about
40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have created
problems for many banks in managing their money effectively.
    Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly
because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth.
The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thai
banking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion
in bank deposits.
    Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have
further buoyed the Thai stock market this week.
    The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index on Monday
recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years, shooting up
4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02.
    Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will register
more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market.
    Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will
grow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission for
local banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct of
bank capital.
    If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expiry
date, many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign
exchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct.
    Bankers said such that could add another five billion baht
of surplus funds to the local money market.

so at 1430 GMT today at a rate of 10 pct for 14 days.
    This compares with the Bank's present band one dealing rate
of 10-3/8 pct.
    The Bank of England's announcement was quickly followed by
Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank which announced a
half-point cut in their base rates to 10 pct from 10-1/2 pct.
    Dealers said the lowering in base rates had been widely
expected following yesterday's U.K. Budget in which Chancellor
of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced a three billion stg cut
in the Government's public sector borrowing target for 1987/88
to four billion stg.
    Many in the market had expected a full one point cut in
base rates today but some were not surprised by the
authorities' caution, dealers added.

<title>NEW ZEALAND ECONOMY FORECAST TO IMPROVE IN 1987/88</title>
<dateline>    WELLINGTON, March 18 - </dateline>New Zealand's inflation and interest
rates should decline and the balance of payments improve
significantly in the fiscal year to the end of March 1988, the
Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) said.
    The independent institute said in its quarterly March issue
that it was also revising its fiscal 1987 real gross domestic
product (GDP) forecast to a fall of 0.5 pct against the one pct
drop forecast in December.
    Government figures show GDP grew at an annual 1.8 pct in
the quarter to September and 3.4 pct in the June quarter.
    The NZIER said the sharp improvement in the June and
September quarters was due mainly to a new tax structure and
the introduction of a 10 pct value-added goods and services tax
and is not expected to continue in the second half of 1986/87.
    The government's tight fiscal position is not expected to
change, it said.
    Annual inflation, measured by the consumer price index, is
forecast to fall to nine pct by next March from 18.2 pct in
calendar 1986, it said.
    ""Falling inflation is likely to give significant scope for
reductions in nominal interest rates; real interest rates are
also expected to ease (albeit slightly) as the balance of
payments deficit and hence the call on overseas capital, falls
away,"" the NZIER said.
    Short-term interest rates are forecast to remain between 20
and 25 pct until the June quarter, but will decline over the
second half of 1987/88 to between 16 and 18 pct. Long-term
rates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct.
    Five year government bond rates are currently 18.40 pct and
the key indicator 30-day bank bills 26.53 pct.
    The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in the
early part of the coming year and, by next March, reach 57.5 on
the Reserve Bank's trade weighted index, which is based on a
basket of currencies. The index now stands at around 66.4.
    ""A marked improvement in the balance of payments is
forecast,"" the NZIER said. ""The current account deficit is
expected to fall from 7.5 pct of GDP in 1985/86 to 4.5 pct in
1986/87 and 2.5 pct in 1987/88.""
    The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 1.32
billion N.Z. Dlrs in 1987/88 from 2.40 billion in 1986/87 and
3.33 billion in 1985/86.
    The 1987/88 budget deficit is forecast to be 2.8 billion
dlrs against an expected 2.9 billion dlrs in 1986/87 and 1.87
billion in 1985/86.
    This compares with the government's 1986/87 deficit figure
of 2.92 billion against an earlier forecast of 2.45 billion.
    ""Conditions in the coming year are sufficiently subdued to
contribute to marked improvements in both the balance of
payments and the rate of inflation ...,"" the NZIER said.
    ""Overall, these are significant gains for the New Zealand
economy and, if they continue to be improved upon, bode well
for future prospects.""

<title>WEST GERMAN BANKS SLOWLY CUTTING KEY SAVINGS RATES</title>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, March 18 - </dateline>West German commercial banks are
cautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, banking
sources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after the
Bundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than the
usual interim period.
    A Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F&gt; spokesman said it is cutting
leading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis
by 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG &lt;DRSD.F&gt;
and Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F&gt; have initiated similar moves. Bank
fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG &lt;BKFG.F&gt; cut rates 0.5 pct generally.
    The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire to
gauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings
banks.
    A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could
reduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them to
draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, one
economist at the German Banking Association said.
    But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially
undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are
parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest
them at higher yields in the future, he said.
    He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more
funds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-dated
securities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money
supply aggregate.
    The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5
pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year,
unchanged from January. The growth rate was outside the
expanded target range of three to six pct.
    Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private
customers, though lending rates for corporate customers are
beginning to decline.

<title>BANK OF ENGLAND LENDS ONE BILLION STG AT 10 PCT</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 18 - </dateline>The Bank of England said it had lent one
billion stg to the discount market for fourteen days at 10 pct.
    This brings the Banks total help today to some 1.34 billion
stg and satisfies the estimated shortage in the system today
which it had earlier estimated at 1.3 billion stg.
    The Bank's announcement this morning that it was willing to
lend two-week money at 10 pct was interpreted by the market as
a sanction for lower U.K. Base lending rates.
    The U.K. Clearing banks swiftly took this up, cutting their
base rates by a half-point to 10 pct. At midday, the central
bank lowered its money market dealing rates by the same amount.

<title>U.K. BASE RATES WILL FALL AGAIN SOON, SAY ANALYSTS</title>
<author>    By Geert Linnebank, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 18 - </dateline>Today's modest half-point cut in U.K.
Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of England's
determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance, but
financial markets appear set to force its hand, analysts said.
    They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2
pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed
a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant.
    Earlier, markets were bracing for a one-point cut in rates
after yesterday's budget set a sharp three billion stg
reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion
stg.
    Sterling money market rates moved lower again, with the key
three-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the start
of business from 9-11/16 9/16 yesterday, and sterling rallied
to four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading.
    Government bond prices also surged on the budget, with
gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paper
below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year.
    But today's smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have
placated markets for now, analysts said. Money market rates
recovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling
and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt.
    Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, and
the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors
was set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher gilt
prices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates.
    ""Today's cut was slightly disappointing,"" said Bill Martin,
chief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. ""The
Bank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temper
the markets' first rush of blood to the head after the budget.""
    Analysts said the bank's move today to lend two-week cash
to U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to
maintain the new rates for about that period of time.
    The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how
sterling performs in the near term.
    Sharp rises in the pound's value could be checked initially
through Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains
would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again.
    ""The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the
time being,"" said Midland Bank treasury economist David
Simmonds. ""But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold
up rates for long.""
    Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Cents
this week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday.
    Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan
Securities, said ""There is another half point to come in the
near term, this week or next week at the latest...We see a
whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks.""
    Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain had
very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling's exchange
rate.
    Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect of
a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not
materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact
on manufactured exports would show almost immediately.
    Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as well
as cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chances
of re-election for the Conservative government and probably
advanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988.
Combined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, this
was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated
assets, pushing the pound's value well above unofficial
targets.
    With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour
because of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase's
Marshall said ""Sterling is simply the best game in town,
especially after the budget, and demand will remain strong.""

<title>VOLATILITY LIKELY TO REMAIN LOW IN DEBT FUTURES</title>
<author>    By Brad Schade Reuters</author>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, March 18 - </dateline>Financial analysts see little chance
that U.S. interest rate futures will break out of their narrow
ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week.
    ""We got a little volatility Wednesday,"" said Staley
Commodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. ""But for the
moment we're still in a trading range.""
    Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the
U.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its
sluggish state, the analysts said.
    ""It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it can
break out of its very low volatility,"" said Carroll McEntee and
McGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. ""It needs something, but it's
not going to be news about the economy,"" he said.
    Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out
of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has
stabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct
monetary policy.
    But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, the
dollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attracted
eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said.
    In addition to a changing perception about the dollar and
monetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinn
said the beginning of April could bring foreign investors back
into the marketplace.
    ""The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the
beginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1,"" Quinn said.
    Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are
large amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japanese
investment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start of
Japan's fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bond
market, he said.
    ""We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bring
yields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct,"" compared to
the current yield of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said.
    In the meantime, even the prospect of new supply is not
likely to move futures.
    The Treasury's announcement of a 15 billion dlr refunding
operation did little to move cash government securities prices
late Wednesday after the close of futures.
    ""I'd be surprised if supply pushed us out of it (the
trading range),"" Lacey said.

<title>GERMAN BANKS SEE LOW INTEREST RATES CONTINUING</title>
<dateline>    BONN, March 19 - </dateline>The Association of German Cooperative
Banks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rates
would continue to remain low for the time being.
    It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strong
foreign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors in
the economy that could affect the long-term capital market.
    The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for
higher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflation
late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in
nominal rates at year's end and next year, it said.
    The association said generally low interest rates,
prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expected
strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment
climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue
its slow but very sure growth.
    The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest
rates down on the short-term money market although its policies
had exerted little effect on the long-term capital market,
which was so important for investment financing and thus for
the course of the economy, it said.
    In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy
had in influencing the longer-term capital market, the
association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy
through a short-term and expansionist monetary policy.
    On the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking
dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987.
    The association said time would show to what extent
speculative foreign money and short-term invested domestic
money would distort money supply developments. The Bundesbank
could hold down money market rates with the highly effective
instrument of sale and repurchase transactions, it said.

<title>GATT MEETING HEARS PLEA FOR AFRICAN DEBT RELIEF</title>
<dateline>    TAUPO, New Zealand, March 23 - </dateline>Debt among African countries
will continue to grow and their economies remain stifled unless
developed countries lower their interest rates, Nigerian Trade
Minister Samaila Mamman said.
    He told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) meeting the widening gap between developed and
developing countries and an inequitable international economic
system were major impediments to growth in developing
countries.
    Delegates from 23 countries are attending the GATT talks in
the New Zealand resort of Taupo.
    ""I wish to emphasise that the growth in the volume of the
external indebtedness of African countries reflects the full
effect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of the
developed market economy countries,"" Mamman said.
    ""The developed market economy countries have slowed down
output growth thereby drying up markets for the commodity
exports of African countries.""
    Mamman said the World Bank estimated 35.3 billion dlrs a
year would be needed over the next five years for the African
continent to be able to achieve a gross domestic product growth
(GDP) rate of three to four pct by 1990.
    Yet at the same time Africa's debt service was estimated at
24.5 billion dlrs a year between 1986 and 1990.
    ""With the best of intentions Africa cannot attain a three to
four pct GDP growth rate if the current high level of debt
persists,"" Mamman said. Developed countries must seek
alternatives to policies that resulted in the transfer of
resources and more indebtedness, he said.
    ""The international community cannot fail to respond
positively to the collapse of the international market for
commodities ... And act quickly to stabilize demand and prices
of our commodity exports,"" he added.

<title>GERMAN BOND YIELDS SEEN FALLING IN NEAR TERM </title>
<author>    By Alice Ratcliffe, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, March 23 - </dateline>West German bond yields could decline
over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize
exchange rates, as seen in last month's Paris pact, extend to
keeping down European interest rates, banking economists said.
    But in the longer term domestic yields could rise under
agreements to stimulate West Germany's economy, they said.
    The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized
currencies with the threat of central bank intervention,
economists said.
    Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolster
the pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest rates
further when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April.
""The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbank
and the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rate
are significant. They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S.
and foreign interest rates,"" Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent
study.
    It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads
was a major factor in the dollar's fall. These spreads will
have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized.
    West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged
the U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when the
Bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoid
weakening the dollar.
    West German economists see room for further cuts in leading
West German rates if the dollar resumes its decline.
    ""It's not a taboo,"" Peter Pietsch, spokesman for Commerzbank
AG said.
    But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates
only in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflation
will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year.
    The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is already
nearing last year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50
pct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April.
 Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to
shift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a move
would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and
long-term rates, which has become more pronounced since the
Bundesbank lowered its discount rate.
    It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, as
the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow
growth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate.
    But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West
German tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed to
meet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move may
force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must
be filled by higher government borrowing.
    This may not occur if private sector demand for credit
remains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising.
    Economists said it appeared the government had already
stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from
other sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker than
expected economic growth, and higher than expected spending.
    Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West German
Ifo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987
tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the
West German government in November.
    Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up.
But coupled with other factors such as waning foreign
speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline, long
term yields may to have to rise, economists said.
    Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to
increases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package.
    The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in
1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion.
    West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased
borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable.
    Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he
was looking for other ways to finance the reform, such as
raising indirect taxes.
    But few economists believe the government will be able to
go through with its tax measures without increasing net
borrowing.
    The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was
wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986
could be managed without increasing deficits.
    The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed
a large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final
quarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985.
    The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of
the fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billion
marks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when it
had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.

billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities
repurchase pact at a rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman

    Banks, which bid for a total 8.6 billion marks liquidity,
will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buy
back securities pledged on April 22.
    The allocation was in line with market expectations the
Bundesbank would provide more than the 3.4 billion marks
draining from this week as an earlier facility expires.
    Call money fell to 3.60/70 pct ahead of the allocation from
3.75/85 pct yesterday, dealers said.
    The excess allocation compensates for public funds leaving
the system which the Bundesbank added last week via
government-owned banks.
    However major tax payments by banks on behalf of customers
drew to a close this week, lessening the need for liquidity.
    The call money declines surprised some dealers, who
speculated it was because the Bundesbank disbursed further
government funds today. However, most said this had not
occurred.
    Banks were well stocked with liquidity, having 47.1 billion
marks in minimum reserves at the Bundesbank on Friday, up from
49.9 billion on Thursday. Average daily reserves over the first
20 days of the month fell to 52.6 billion from 53.1 billion.

<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 24 - </dateline>American Express Co's &lt;AXP&gt; recent
launch of a new ""OPTIMA"" credit card, with relatively low
interest rates and fees, will increase competition with bank
credit-card issuers but will not lead to a pricing war, a

marketing efforts on acceptance, noting that Visa and
Mastercard currently enjoy a two-to-one advantage over American

<title>BANK OF SPAIN PROVIDES YEAR RECORD ASSISTANCE FUNDS</title>
<dateline>    MADRID, March 26 - </dateline>The Bank of Spain provided 1,145 billion

of fresh increases in overnight rates.
    The daily auction was the biggest of the year and comes
after the previous record set last June 6 of 1,240 billion

    A spokesman for one of Spain top five banks said higher
overnight call money rates were expected in the short term in
view of disappointing money supply figures for February.
    The M-4 money supply, measured as liquid assets in public
hands, rose 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January and
compared with this year's eight pct target. Money supply growth
was 11.4 pct last year.
    The central bank on Tuesday raised overnight rates by a
quarter of a percentage point to 14 pct on demand for 746
billion pesetas. Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the
year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising
demand for funds. ""The policy is proving counter-productive and
rates will have to come down in the long-term,"" the bank

<title>FED'S POLICY EASE MAY END WITH 2ND QTR RATE CUT</title>
<author>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </dateline>The Federal Reserve's move to easier
monetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount rate
cuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in the
second quarter, analysts said.
    A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to
edge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending rate
from 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy.
    ""The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further without
a full-blown recession,"" said Raymond Stone, chief financial
economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
    Stone said economic data available by late June may be just
weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he said
it may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half
point, to avoid hurting the dollar further.
    All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market
Committee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged.
    The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly
quarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasury
bond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at which
banks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the prime
lending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct.
    Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly to
the April-June quarter, follow:
    - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further
against other major currencies because of a large U.S. budget
deficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted after
the dollar's steep drop in the last two business days, the
economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that
the dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect.
    - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue
trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well
test the lower end of that range.
    - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and
probably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strong
foreign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. The
outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year
since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up.
    - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator
will rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. The
sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as will
a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year.
    - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pct
annual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand at
respective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 first
and second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pct
annual
rate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter.
    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees
both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among
those surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pct
rate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate this
quarter and 3.5 pct next quarter.
    ""The economy will bounce back more strongly than many
expect,"" Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup in
inventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quarter
economic growth, with consumer spending helping later.
    ""We're running out of special factors to keep the economy
afloat,"" said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. His
interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest.
    Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation
helped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively.
He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that second
quarter growth could be zero or negative.
    Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer
from a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow 
government spending and less construction. Only a marginally
narrower trade deficit will add to growth.
    He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds,
with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct,
respectively. Nikko's Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct for
bonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate.
    Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly
after the dollar's fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in past
days and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan.
    David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc
raised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20
pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct.
    Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, lifted
his forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point
to eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho and
Resler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct.
    The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese
investors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fear
about further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S.
trade sanctions. Yields may have to rise to lure other buyers.

<title>ANALYSTS SEE SLOW MOVE TO HIGHER U.S. PRIME RATE</title>
<author>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </dateline>Quarter-point prime rate increases to
7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will be
followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of
the Federal Reserve's policy intentions, economists said.
    ""Based on the spread between banks' cost of funds and the
prime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, but
no rush is likely,"" said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co.
    Citibank's surprise base rate increase, quickly followed by
Chase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher.
    McCulley said that once the spread between three-month
certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than
1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a prime
rate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently.
    However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until they
see what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near
term, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like to
follow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example,
the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks
lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount
rate increase in April of that year.
    Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since
last August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pct
shortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to the
current 5-1/2 pct level on August 20.
    ""The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There
should be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2
pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G.
Lanston and Co.
    Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today's
meeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may
well foster higher interest rates soon.
    Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policy
change today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate
pressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat
up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery.
    ""The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to
tighten policy when they did today's coupon pass,"" said Joseph
Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co.
    In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the
Fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by
offering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for
its own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a ""pass.""
    ""The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy
change,"" said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. 
    She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and the
prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153
basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not
really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate
increase.
    The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise
""may have been less a response to interest rates than an
attempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line.""
    Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans to
developing countries, large money center banks with heavy
exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in
an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.
    The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money
to one another could help determine how many banks match the
higher prime rate and also how quickly they move.
    In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of
funds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federal
funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly
6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.  
    The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting
demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the
close of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five
and 6-3/4 pct.
    Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds
rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the
6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there,
banks may not quickly boost their prime rates.
    But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many
that the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to
help the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly.

<title>SEIPP SAYS GERMAN INTEREST RATES SHOULD FALL</title>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, April 1 - </dateline>The Bundesbank should take further
steps to reduce German interest rates to protect the mark from
further appreciation and to persuade investors to bring
long-term yields lower, Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F&gt; management
board chairman Walter Seipp said.
    But he told the bank's annual news conference this did not
mean a cut in leading interest rates, rather a reduction in
money market rates through bringing the allocation rates down
for Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements.
    ""Leading interest rates are not the decisive rates,"" he said.
""The money market rates are the important ones.""
    Seipp said the Bundesbank should move away from allocating
money market liquidity at a fixed 3.8 pct as it has in recent
tender allocations.
    An easier monetary policy would not mean a loss of
credibility for the Bundesbank in its containment of monetary
growth. A fall in short rates would make the public aware of
the high yields in bonds and lead to a longer-term capital
formation, braking the expansion of money supply.
    ""Thus, you can have lower rates and also a normalisation of
monetary growth both at the same time,"" he added.
    Seipp said there were no grounds to paint too black a
picture of the German economy, since company profitability had
improved over recent years and domestic oriented firms were
profiting from cheaper imports because of the rise in the mark.
    Growth this year should be at least one pct, he said,
describing the downturn in production in the first months as a
false start, unrepresentative of the rest of the year.
    After an economic contraction in the first quarter, the
economy should show an uptrend in the last three. ""We don't
believe that the economy has tipped over, but see it more as a
'growth dip,'"" Seipp said.
    But Seipp also called for support for growth from fiscal
policy, saying the top rate of income and corporate tax should
be brought down to 49 pct. The current peak rate is 56 pct.
    The additional tax cuts brought forward to next January
were no substitute for support for growth.
    Seipp added the federal government should make ""further
courageous steps to decrease the state's proportion of the
German economy and to increase its flexibility.""

<title>H.K. BANKS TO RAISE PRIME RATES SOON, DEALERS SAY</title>
<dateline>    HONG KONG, April 1 - </dateline>Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raise
prime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following a
one-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banks
yesterday, dealers said.
    They told Reuters local banks may decide on the increase at
this weekend's routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association of
Banks.
    G.C. Goh, chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, said
prime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to

pct, the level at beginning of 1987.
    The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five
pct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 on
January 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kong
dollar, he said.
    The medium and longer term interbank rates firmed today,
with three months ending at 5-1/16 to 4-7/8 pct against
yesterday's five to 4-13/16 close. The overnight rate, however,

interest have been abolished.
    Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the
government's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help
improve world competitiveness of Indian goods.
    There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank deposits
by long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will create
the flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equity
shares or short-term bank deposits, they said.
    A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs due
to lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market.
    Tata Steel, a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange,
opened today higher at 1,040 rupees against yesterday's closing
of 1,012.50 rupees.
    A stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic now
to buy convertible and non-convertible debentures because the
Finance Ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 12.5
pct and 14 pct respectively from 13.5 and 15 pct respectively.
    ""But overall debenture prospects remain bright because the
rates of interest on them will still be higher than what banks
pay for deposits of similar maturity,"" a merchant banker said.

<title>H.K. BANKS TO RAISE PRIME RATES SOON, DEALERS SAY</title>
<dateline>    HONG KONG, April 1 - </dateline>Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raise
prime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following a
one-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banks
yesterday, dealers said.
    They told Reuters local banks may decide on the increase at
this weekend's routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association of
Banks.
    G.C. Goh, chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, said
prime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to
7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 may prompt Hong Kong banks to follow suit.
    Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6-1/2
pct, the level at beginning of 1987.
    The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five
pct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 on
January 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kong
dollar, he said.
    The medium and longer term interbank rates firmed today,
with three months ending at 5-1/16 to 4-7/8 pct against
yesterday's five to 4-13/16 close. The overnight rate, however,
fell to 3-1/2 to three pct from 4-1/2 to four because of
increased liquidity for a local stock issue.

<title>LOWER INTEREST RATES SEEN FOLLOWING IRISH BUDGET</title>

<title>U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - PRIME RATE</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </dateline>The prospect that other banks will
follow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raising
their prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit
markets today, economists said.
    Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days
of heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market by
announcing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4
pct. Chase Manhattan quickly followed.
    Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar
- the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on the
news.
    Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in the
Euromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate.
    Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears
of a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, but
economists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whose
policy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets this
week, is already tightening its grip on credit.
    ""The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the
banking system's reserve needs this statement period, but I
wouldn't conclude anything until I've seen the Fed data,"" said
Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank.

<title>AUSTRIAN BANKS DIVIDED OVER INTEREST RATE CUT</title>
<dateline>    VIENNA, April 1 - </dateline>Calls for a cut in Austrian interest
rates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are divided
over the issue.
    Karl Vak, General Director of the Zentralsparkasse und
Kommerzialbank, Wien, called today for a cut of up to half a
percentage point in interest rates across the board. But Hannes
Androsch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI&gt; told
Reuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers.
    Vak told a news conference that last January's cut in
lending rates for commercial customers and for all depositors
by a quarter point had been insufficient.
    The January cut followed the National Bank's lowering of
its discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with a
similar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct and
deposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct.
    Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the Genossenschaftliche
Zentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of a
point, or even half a point if German rates dropped further.
    Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. A
widening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West German
credit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growth
this year also justified a further interest drop, he said.
    Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank der
oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [GIRV.VI] has also called for
lower deposit rates but said lending rates should remain
unchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small,
particularly when compared with other West European countries.
    But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste Oesterreichische
Spar-Casse-Bank told Reuters that no cut should be made unless
West German rates came down first.
    Banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower rates
alone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcoming
opposition from Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank.

    The new rate is among changes agreed last month to the 20.3

interest rate will be retroactive to April 1, provided the
accord is approved before October 1.
    He told reporters the term sheet detailing the changes in
the rescheduling has already been endorsed by the 13-member
debt steering committee and is now being sent to the country's
460 creditor banks for their approval.

<title>FURTHER DECLINES IN U.S. DEBT FUTURES POSSIBLE</title>
<author>    By Brad Schade, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, April 1 - </dateline>After an already steep fall in the past
week, U.S. interest rate futures may be in for further declines
in the near term, financial analysts said.
    However, some analysts said recent sharp losses in bond
futures have left the bond market somewhat oversold, and the
contracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery before
resuming their decline.
    Key to the near-term direction of futures will be the
course of the dollar, they said.
    ""As the dollar goes, so goes the bond market,"" said Dean
Witter analyst Karen Gibbs.
    The recent decline in the dollar, which hit a 40-year low
against the Japanese yen Monday, was reversed Wednesday when
several large U.S. money center banks unexpectedly raised their
prime lending rates by a quarter point, to 7-3/4 pct.
    ""Even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar,
foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar decline
is over,"" Gibbs said.
    The dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debt
futures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation.
    Indeed, the falling dollar may have been a key topic at the
meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy making arm, the Federal
Open Market Committee, this week, analysts said.
    ""To the Fed, the combination of a falling dollar, a
steepening yield curve, and rising commodity prices look
suspiciously like the traces of expectations of accelerating
inflation,"" said Denis Karnosky, analyst at Carroll, McEntee
and McGinley Inc.
    Such expectations could mean that ""a shift in policy toward
restriction of bank reserves is likely to get very serious
consideration,"" at the FOMC meeting, he said.
    Any such restriction of reserves will not be a highly
visible form of monetary tightening, Karnosky said.
    Rather, the key to detecting a change will be found in
seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window, he
said. Borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mln
dlrs over the past several months, he said.
    In the meantime, however, ""the market looks a bit
oversold,"" said Jim Wysoglad, analyst at Golden Gate Futures.
    Wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition could
drive June bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to test
chart support near the recent low of 97-13/32.
    Technician Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston
said that the key test for June bonds will be whether the
nearby contract holds above chart support at 96-24/32.
    ""All previous selloffs since mid-November have stopped and
buyers have surfaced at that level,"" Keefe said.
    If that level is broken, and the dollar continues to
decline, Keefe said she expects the June bond contract to
decline to test support between 92 and 93, the primary uptrend
line dating back to 1984.

<title>LAWSON REMARKS DASH HOPES OF EARLY U.K. RATE CUT</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 2 - </dateline>Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise
exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling,
dashing hopes for an early cut in U.K. Base rates, analysts
said.
    But the market's reaction, testing exchange rate levels
indicated by Lawson, was probably overdone and the longer term
outlook for sterling remained bullish, they agreed.
    In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy,
Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he
was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current
levels, specifying rates of around 1.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs.
    Lawson added the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling
at about present levels, using currency intervention and
interest rates to achieve this.
    The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and
Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to
include target ranges, but all participants to the meeting had
so far refused to specify these.
    Markets were quick to react to the statement, chopping
about one U.S. Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match
the levels mentioned by Lawson.
    But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawson's
statement signalled a change in U.K. Policy.
    Keith Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel
and Co, said, ""the remarks have been blown out of proportion.
Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue.""
    Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said, ""there is
nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellor's statement.""
    He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the
Chancellor were precise targets, but merely represented central
rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate,
perhaps by as much as 10 pct.
    ""It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an
election ... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie
himself to a fixed rate,"" Brett said.
    Currency markets were keen for official statements to
clarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency
trading. This mood easily led to over-reaction, analysts said.
    ""Making similar statements when the market is high strung
and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake,"" one senior dealer
with a U.S. Bank said.
    Capel's Skeoch said, ""it gives the foreign exchange markets
something to shoot at.""
    ""It is obvious that the government, as a member of the Group
of Six, has agreed exchange rate bands. But they are not cut in
stone, they can change with time,"" Skeoch said.
    Brett said, ""we think the 2.90 marks level is a central
rate. Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine.""
    Not all analysts played down the significance of the
remarks, however. Chris Dunn, economist at Royal Bank of
Canada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate
sterling from the fortunes of the dollar.
    Although about two-thirds of Britain's trade is conducted
with European countries, sterling has traditionally shadowed
the dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted.
    ""Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Or
throw in its lot with Europe,"" Dunn said.
    ""It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying to
join the European Monetary System, it is seeking protection by
shadowing it ... The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants
the U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark,"" he said.
    Analysts said sterling's dip on currency markets following
Lawson's remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Base
rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term.
    ""Over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get some
extremely good economic indicators,"" Capel's Skeoch said.
    Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March,
the last after the March 17 budget presentation, and analysts
had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards.

rates on one, two and three-month treasury certificates to 7.30
pct from 7.40 pct effective immediately, the bank said in a

    The Bank last adjusted its short-term treasury certificate
rates on March 23, when it also reduced rates for all three
periods by 0.10 points.
    A National Bank spokesman said the latest adjustment would
bring the rates closer in line with currently prevailing
interbank interest rates.
    The spokesman said it was too early to predict whether the
move would herald a reduction in discount rate, which currently
stands at eight pct, when the Bank holds its regular weekly
meeting at which the rate is discussed next Wednesday.
    The discount rate generally moves in tandem with the
