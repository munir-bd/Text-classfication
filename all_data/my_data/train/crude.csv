<title>DIAMOND SHAMROCK (DIA) CUTS CRUDE PRICES</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, FEB 26 - </dateline>Diamond Shamrock Corp said that
effective today it had cut its contract prices for crude oil by
1.50 dlrs a barrel.
    The reduction brings its posted price for West Texas
Intermediate to 16.00 dlrs a barrel, the copany said.
    ""The price reduction today was made in the light of falling
oil product prices and a weak crude oil market,"" a company
spokeswoman said.
    Diamond is the latest in a line of U.S. oil companies that
have cut its contract, or posted, prices over the last two days
citing weak oil markets.

<title>OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS</title>
<author>    BY TED D'AFFLISIO, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </dateline>OPEC may be forced to meet before a
scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting
agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide
in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.
    ""The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy
as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out
the problems,"" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, CERA.
    Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC
faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.
    ""OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production
issue and must be addressed in that way,"" said Paul Mlotok, oil
analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
    He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its
ability to keep production under control have given way to a
pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if
it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.
    But some other analysts were uncertain that even an
emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production
above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.
    ""OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have
deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,"" said the
regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke
on condition that he not be named. ""The market is now trying to
teach them that lesson again,"" he added.
    David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC
to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is
not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.
    ""They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the
winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April
when demand slackens,"" Mizrahi said.
    But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more
than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.""
    Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for
OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.
    ""OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks
since buyers will come back into the market then,"" said Dillard
Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.
    But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy
and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil
has been rising through the first quarter and this may have
prompted excesses in its production.
    ""Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd
and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we
are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this
demand through current production,"" he told Reuters in a
telephone interview.

<title>KUWAIT SAYS NO PLANS FOR EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS</title>
<dateline>    KUWAIT, March 1 - </dateline>Kuwait""s Oil Minister, in remarks
published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC
meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world
oil prices.
    Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local
daily al-Qabas as saying: ""None of the OPEC members has asked
for such a meeting.""
    He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000
barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production
limits of the 13-nation organisation.
    Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln
bpd agreed in Geneva last December.
    They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with
the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above
quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.
    ""This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said
Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that
because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,"" the minister
said.
    Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to
produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.
    ""If we can sell more than our quota at official prices,
while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their
share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,"" he said.
    He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar,
which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd
of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting
official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker
of 18 dlrs per barrel.
    Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels
this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of
19 dollars a barrel.
    Sheikh Ali also delivered ""a challenge to any international
oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.""
    Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a
barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.
    However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because
of its local and international refining facilities and its own
distribution network abroad, he added.
    He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC""s
differentials committee has been postponed until the start of
April at the request of certain of the body""s members.
    Ecuador""s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said
last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign
a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at
talks this month of opec""s pricing committee.
    Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in
apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: ""We
expected such pressure. It will continue through March and
April."" But he expected the situation would later improve.

<title>INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE</title>
<author>    By Jeremy Clift, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, March 1 - </dateline>Indonesia appears to be nearing a
political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected
economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.
    To counter falling oil revenues, the government has
launched a series of measures over the past nine months to
boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new
investment.
    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading
primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year""s
fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its
currency by 31 pct in September.
    But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto""s
government appears to be divided over what direction to lead
the economy.
    ""(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to
deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,""
the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia""s agricultural
sector, but also reviews the country""s general economic
performance.
    It says that while many government officials and advisers
are recommending further relaxation, ""there are equally strong
pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.""
    ""This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,""
the report says.
    Indonesia""s economic changes have been welcomed by the World
Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction,
though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and
steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.
    Three sets of measures have been announced since last May,
which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade
restrictions and liberalised imports.
    The report says Indonesia""s economic growth in calendar 1986
was probably about zero, and the economy may even have
contracted a bit. ""This is the lowest rate of growth since the
mid-1960s,"" the report notes.
    Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a
population of 168 million, is facing general elections in
April.
    But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement
in the economic outlook. ""For 1987 early indications point to a
slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic
activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export
earnings from the petroleum industry.""
    ""Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak
domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real
declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of
growth in agriculture,"" the report states.
    Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is
crucial for the government to get the international lending its
needs.
    A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance
of payments support was given partly to help the government
maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.

<title>SAUDI RIYAL DEPOSIT RATES REMAIN FIRM</title>

steady at yesterday's higher levels in a quiet market.
    Traders said they were reluctant to take out new positions

    Oil industry sources said yesterday several Gulf Arab
producers had had difficulty selling oil at official OPEC

    A traditional Sunday lull in trading due to the European

<title>QATAR UNVEILS BUDGET FOR FISCAL 1987/88</title>
<dateline>    DOHA, March 1 - </dateline>The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering
slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices,
announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a
deficit of 5.472 billion riyals.
    The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals
in the last published budget for 1985/86.
    In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year
1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh
Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to
spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.
    Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6
billion riyals.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about
6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86
projected revenue of 9.7 billion.
    The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to
uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government
decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to
one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15
pct.
    He urged heads of government departments and public
institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He
did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in
1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on
the country's foreign reserves.
    He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been
allocated for major projects including housing and public
buildings, social services, health, education, transport and
communications, electricity and water, industry and
agriculture.
    No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and
security. There was also no projection for oil revenue.
    Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000
barrels per day.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: ""Our expectations of positive signs
regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's
determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its
wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming
year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota.""

<title>SAUDI ARABIA REITERATES COMMITMENT TO OPEC PACT</title>
<dateline>    BAHRAIN, March 1 - </dateline>Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
reiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC
accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market, the
official Saudi Press Agency SPA said.
    Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market
oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia ""is fully adhering by the
... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the
pronounced prices under any circumstance.""
    Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market
prices ""may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere)
winter season and the glut in the market.""
    Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord,
under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by
7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed
prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets,
which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in
mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices
are currently just over 16 dlrs.
    Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's
adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market.
    He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all
wanted to stick to the accord.
    In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also
Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the
pricing agreement.
    ""We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate
the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the
fundamentals exist for stable market conditions,"" he said.
    Kuwait's Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said
in remarks published in the emirate's daily Al-Qabas there were
no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices.
    Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling.
    They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with
the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above
quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing.

<title>SAUDI FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT PUT AT 3.5 MLN BPD</title>
<dateline>    ABU DHABI, March 2 - </dateline>Saudi crude oil output last month fell
to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd
in January, Gulf oil sources said.
    They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah
terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month
from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some
customers.
    But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf
exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd
from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.
    The production figures include neutral zone output but not
sales from floating storage, which are generally considered
part of a country's output for Opec purposes.
    Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a
production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group
last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs
a barrel.
    The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week
appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February
entitlements before the month-end.
    Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued
support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude
customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.
    The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON&gt;, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB&gt;, Texaco Inc
&lt;TX&gt; and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV&gt; -- signed a long-term agreement
last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.
    However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's
ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will
come this month, when demand for petroleum products
traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent
weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.
    Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday
reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord
and said it would never sell below official prices.
    The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell
slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in
January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export
refineries.
    They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd
last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at
Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady
at around 200,000 bpd each.

<title>NYMEX WILL EXPAND OFF-HOUR TRADING APRIL ONE</title>
<author>     By BERNICE NAPACH, Reuters</author>
<dateline>     NEW YORK, March 2 - </dateline>The New York Mercantile Exchange set
April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy
complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide.
     On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not
hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes,
a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures
market, according to an exchange spokeswoman.
    ""This will change the way oil is transacted in the real
world,"" said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman.
    Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX
prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a
differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained.
     The expanded program ""will serve the industry because the
oil market does not close when NYMEX does,"" said Frank Capozza,
secretary of Century Resources Inc.
     The rule change, which has already taken effect for
platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open
interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to
traders and analysts.
    Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called
an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position
before entering into the transaction.
    Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a
futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both
parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures
contract the next day, according to exchange officials.
    When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December,
NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, ""Expansion of the EFP
provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by
providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading.""
    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule
change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman.

against conducting oil activities in the Aegean Sea, said today
it had the right to decide where and how to do research or
drilling work in the area.
    A government spokesman said the Greek position was made
clear to Turkey's ambassador Nazmi Akiman when he met Greek
Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Yannis Kapsis last week.
    Acting Turkish Prime Minister Kaya Erdem said earlier today
Greek activities in the northern Aegean contravened the 1976
Berne Agreement which set the framework for talks on the Aegean
continental shelf disputed between Ankara and Athens.
    The Greek statement today said, ""Greece is not prepared to
give up even a trace of its sovereignty rights to the seabed.
It has been stressed to...Mr Akiman that the decision where or
how to drill belongs exclusively to the Greek government.""
    ""The Greek government has repeatedly let the Turkish side
know that it considers the 1976 Berne protocol as inactive
through the fault of Turkey,"" it said.
    The Greek statement said Athens was ready to put the
continental shelf issue before international courts.

    He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that
present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of
warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for
oil.
    Prices had also been forced down because refineries were

""Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)."" He did not elaborate.
    He said there appeared to have been some attempts to
manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the
cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through
present price difficulties.
    He predicted that prices would recover again in the third

    He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency

    Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock
deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price
to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members

<title>PEMEX SIGNS 500 MLN DLR JAPAN LOAN FOR PIPELINE</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 3 - </dateline>Mexican state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos
(Pemex) signed for a 500 mln dlruntied loan from the
Export-Import Bank of Japan to finance its Pacific Petroleum
Project, Pemex Japan representative Tito Ayal said.
    No further details on the loan were immediately available.
    Ayala told an oil seminar the project, due for completion
in 1988, is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in
the domestic market, mainly along the Pacific coast.
    The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on
the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, and
construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery.
    The project also includes construction of liquified
petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz, additional
crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline, an ammonia
complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion
of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz, Ayala said.
    Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and
materials for the project, he said. The new pipeline will
enable Japan to load Mexico's Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz
rather than in the Gulf of Mexico. Pemex will also have some
LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help Japan
diversify its supply sources of that product, he added.

<title>OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT</title>
<author>    BY TED D'AFFLISIO, REUTERS</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, MARCH 3 - </dateline>Crude oil prices rallied today, moving
over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined
effort to support prices, analysts said.
    ""The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,
hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without
another meeting,"" said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
    ""But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to
seasonal declines in demand and some cheating,"" he added.
    Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt
to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from
the official prices agreed to last december.
    The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,
Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers
of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the
Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.
    The Saudis have also offered to support members having
difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.
    ""They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to
prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC
member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members
that lose sales,"" Margoshes said.
    He added that the allocations would probably be in the form
of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.
    Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line
nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it
is also likely that such assistance would be provided to
Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.
    Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC
president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC
meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the
December pact is falling apart.
    Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham
Harris and Co said, ""both physical and futures markets have been
oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short
covering rally.""
    He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which
refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners
into the market to cover their short positions.
    Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market
to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast
sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading
yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the
North sea crude oil market.
    Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today
that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent
for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels
being fixed to make such shipments.
    North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades
reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.
    OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their
quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.
    Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC
production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last
december but he gave no details on OPEC production against
claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.
    ""The production probably is about their quota level and
largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell
its oil as a result,"" Margoshes said.
    Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the
current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if
Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.
    But others said that despite the rally today there were
still several fundamental factors, including demand, which
could cut the rally short.
    Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said
slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep
demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise
about 1.4 pct over 1986.

<title>SAUDI SUCCESS SEEN IN CURBING OPEC PRODUCTION</title>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, March 3 - </dateline>Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuring
other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan
Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer.
    Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil
engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to
attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years
to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.
    ""Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concerted
effort by the Saudis to get production down,"" Wellemeyer said.
    ""The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a
barrel) and are willing to make it happen again,"" he said.
    In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a
barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing
above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln
barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S.
crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a
belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.
    Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production
could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as
early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.
    Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil
should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the
organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a
barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from
switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market
accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the
world demand for oil.

<title>ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION</title>
<author>    BY MICHAEL FITZPATRICK, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LOS ANGELES, March 4 - </dateline>Drilling for oil in California is
likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels
despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts
said.
    Because much of the crude oil in California fields is
thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to
increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery
is seen in drilling, they said.
    ""Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,""
said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.
    Few new wells now are being drilled.
    Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,
were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared
to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil
Information Services, which tracks California drilling
activity.
    ""It's in the dregs right now,"" said Bolster of the state's
drilling activity.
    Current prices are not enough to justify increased
drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent
Producers Association.
    While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact
to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices
eventually fell.
    Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have
slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high
of about 17 dlrs.
    More than half of California's oil comes from stripper
wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that
much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to
extract, Malmgreen said.
    ""It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,""
Malmgreen said.
    Many stripper wells along the southern California coast
produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland
wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur
extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.
    The outlook for future production in California is clouded
by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.
    In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which
produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory
drilling has slowed to a crawl.
    Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in
1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of
the state energy commission. So far this year only five
exploratory wells have been drilled.
    ""I don't think they'll even get to what they did last
year,"" Mitchell said.
    No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of
the decade, Mitchell said.
    Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the
number of producing wells and overall production.
    Between February and October of 1986, the number of
producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from
more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy
Commission.
    In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output
fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is
expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.
    Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil
production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels
per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.
    Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986
was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405
mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of
Conservation.
    ""Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,""
Guerard said.

<dateline>    LONDON, March 4 - </dateline>The U.K. Offshore oil industry has
suffered from last year's collapse in oil prices but should not
sustain any permament damage, Minister of State for Energy
Alick Buchanan-Smith said.
    The drilling, diving and supply vessels sectors had been
most affected, Buchanan Snith told the House of Commons energy

spending six mln stg a day to maintain North Sea production.
    He added that a report by the manpower services committee

    Prices of North Sea Brent-grade crude dipped to a low of
8.50
dlrs a barrel last July from a peak of over 30 dlrs the
previous November.
    They recovered to around 18 dlrs a barrel after last
December's OPEC meeting and Brent traded today around 17.15

    Buchanan-Smith said the U.K. Has no intention of adopting

<title>TEXAS OIL REGULATOR CALLS FOR STATE TAX BREAKS</title>
<dateline>    AUSTIN, Texas, March 4 - </dateline>Texas Railroad Commissioner James
Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for
Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt
incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance
taxes on oil produced from stripper wells.
    Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of
representatives that the state must take the initiative in
molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist
troubled oil producers.
    His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt
stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day
from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the
majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well
category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be
crucial in determining if the well remains in production.
    Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new
wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years
as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.
    Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of
production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover
oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent
said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary
wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day
for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a
barrel.
    ""We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal
administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the
nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough,"" Nugent
said. ""In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead,
follow, or get out of the way.""
    Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury
by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes
would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the
oil supply and service industry.

<dateline>    PORT MORESBY, March 5 - </dateline>The Papua New Guinea Government
will establish a public corporation to invest in resources
projects, Minerals and Energy Minister John Kaputin said.
    ""We intend to provide a means through which less privileged
individuals can become part owners and beneficiaries from the
development of mining and petroleum projects,"" he told
Parliament.
    Existing policy allowing the state up to 30 pct equity in
major mining projects and 22.5 pct in oil and gas projects
would be maintained, he said. The planned agency could take
over the state's equity in current developments.
    Kaputin said Papua New Guinea was experiencing a boom with
exploration companies spending about 60 mln kina annually on
about 150 mining and 23 petroleum projects.
    ""The Government is determined to ensure that Papua New
Guinean ownership in minerals and petroleum projects increases
in an orderly way,"" he said.
    Kaputin did not say when the corporation would be
established or exactly what form it would take, but said the
government would study whether it should be directly involved
in exploration or development.

<title>EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING</title>
<author>    By Andrew Hill, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 5 - </dateline>OPEC crude oil output in the first few
days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16
mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd
ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows.
    The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil
traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle
East, Africa, Latin America and Asia.
    They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the
group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to
a fixed price system, which came into effect last month.
    OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd
above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the
United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show.
    The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador,
was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the
survey reveals.
    But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall
in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran""s inability to
export as much as its quota allows.
    Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced
1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed.
    Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to
3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February,
against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a
200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.
    Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was
estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in
early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share
of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.
    Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some
OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria,
both substantially under quota in February and early March.
    Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to
180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.
    Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar""s
prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any
shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.
    Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down
from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd.
    Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonny
grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes
from the U.K. North Sea.
    Country-by-country production figures are as follows, in
mln bpd -

<title>OPEC SAYS FEBRUARY OUTPUT UNDER CEILING</title>
<dateline>    VIENNA, March 5 - </dateline>OPEC output in February was ""well below""
the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countries
are strictly adhering to their quotas, the OPEC news agency
Opecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying.
    The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the
result ""of member countries' firm determination to defend the
organisation's official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and to
refrain from selling any quantity below that price.""
    The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no
OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session
planned to start on June 25.
    The official gave no figure for February output. The
statement said only that ""the reduction in total supplies,
namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local
deliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as
those supplies fell very noticeably during that month.""
    ""No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters
to align the official selling price to the ongoing market
price, member countries are, without exception, strictly
adhering to the official selling price in spite of the
financial hardship this may entail,"" the statement said.
    ""The very recent improvement in the price structure is an
indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to
the official selling price,"" the statement said.
    Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a
barrel in early December last year to near OPEC's official
levels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact.
    There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might
have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled
June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some
states and strains on the differential matrix, which prices
each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main
markets.
    The official said in the statement that no such emergency
session was scheduled ""because of member countries' firm
determination to defend the price (system)"" agreed in December.
    Opec""s differential committee was to have met in Vienna
starting April 2 but this session has been postponed, with no
new date set, according to an official of the United Arab
Emirates, which chairs the seven-state body.
    Other members are Algeria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya,
Nigeria and Qatar.

<title>OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING</title>
<author>    By Judith Matloff, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 5 - </dateline>Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman
said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd
ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been
delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec
prices.
    Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from
Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in
February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were
strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they
were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official
prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    ""We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,""
he said. ""I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they
are committed to making the accord work,"" he said.
    Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He
said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these
figures.
    Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated
that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he
said; ""That could well be correct.""
    Opec""s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying
group output was ""well below"" its ceiling in February. But it
gave no figures.
    But one source close to Opec indicated that February output
may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd.
    The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around
16 mln bpd.
    Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8
mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1.
    Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all
produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said
it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December
pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said.
    Lukman said that some industry reports ""may be correct"" that
in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238
mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln
allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.
    He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his
country were coming under price pressure because they were
currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and
the United States"" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude.
    However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that
demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons
and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.
    ""We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is
now firming on actual fundamentals,"" he said, adding that he
expected it to go ""up and up"" even beyond official prices after
early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand
for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria""s.
    The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela
and Indonesia were having less problems with output than
producers like his own country because they exported oil
products.
    Also, some of Venezuela""s heavy grades were outside the Opec
pricing system, he said.
    Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift
some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks
and ran them down to ""dangerous levels,"" they would eventually
have to buy Opec oil.
    ""When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market)
they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more
later on,"" he said.
    Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being
pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was
important to know that terms with them were negotiable,
flexible and under constant review, not only when the market
seemed weak.
    He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation
ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that
such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority
for Opec at the moment.
    ""At this time, we have to get our priorities right,"" he said.
""The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is
working, not dealing with a differential of cents between
grades.""
    But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over
the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.

<title>CONFIDENCE IN OPEC FIRMS U.S. ENERGY FUTURES</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </dateline>Renewed confidence in OPEC's ability to
limit production helped U.S. energy futures settle above
yesterday's closing prices, according to analysts.
    They also said the heating oil contract found additional
support from a short-covering rally on the close.
    April crude closed 24 cts higher to 17.75 dlrs. April
heating oil was 1.47 cts higher to 47.91 cts a gallon.
    ""Most traders expected follow through profit-taking from

    News today, including OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman

official quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day, helped bouy prices,
traders said. A Reuter survey found OPEC production in early
March was 14.7 mln bpd.
    In addition to short-covering, heating oil found support
from traders buying it against sales of gasoline and crude, as
well as from expectations for continued drawdowns in stocks as
refiners shut down for maintenance, traders said.

<title>IEA SAYS OPEC FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT 16.1 MLN BPD</title>

per day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln the
previous month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter

    A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production
quotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings
were reduced from several countries, it said in its latest
monthly oil market report.
    These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to

    The IEA said while Saudi production stayed below its quota
of 4.133 mln bpd, actual sales might exceed output due to
Norbec stock disposals. Contracts for Saudi crude have been
signed, but it is understood they have much leeway in required
liftings.
    The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on
Iranian export facilities allowed Iran's output to reach 2.2
mln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed prices
apparently cut February production.
    It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the
Turkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and
0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal
consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd.
    The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in
February at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and
47.0 mln in the fourth quarter.
    The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd
OPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids
(ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other

    Within the OECD, preliminary Norwegian data show record

<title>CRUDE OIL PRICES UP AS STOCKS, OUTPUT FALL</title>
<author>    BY TED D'AFFLISIO, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </dateline>U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 
dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price
could rise another dollar as inventories fall.
    ""OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market
there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time
to major refining centers,"" said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. ""That could send prices
50 cts to a dollar higher,"" he added.
    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to
18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.
    The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in
February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a
barrel.
    ""Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that
oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its
15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come
under question,"" McKinley said.
    Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly
report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in
industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during
the first quarter of this year.
    IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first
quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose
inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln
tonnes, or about 74 days consumption.
    Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd
draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday
fed speculation that other major companies were destocking.
    Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a
so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying
officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization
to offer discounts to the official price.
    ""This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the
ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively
soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),""
the general trading manager of an international oil company
told Reuters in a telephone interview.
    For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting
excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own
output, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to
be 14.7 mln bpd this week.
    Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend
oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.
    ""This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000
bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues,
the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting
it to be there,"" McKinley said.
    International oil traders said that other short-haul
crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian
refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily
available Mideast crudes earlier this week.
    If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up
the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading
managers at several companies told Reuters.
    But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long
OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.
    Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity
Management, said OPEC production was lower ""because of the
Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it
gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.""
     He added, ""The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other
members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the
Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low
as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price,"" he added.
    There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the
spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.
    Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery
into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which
traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of
18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.
    Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far
East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.
    ""There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government
deals, which are below official prices and this is probably
being resold,"" one international trader said.

<title>ECUADOR ADOPTS AUSTERITY MEASURES AFTER QUAKE</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 7 - </dateline>OPEC member Ecuador adopted austerity
measures to conserve fuel after oil production was paralyzed by
a strong earthquake.
    Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa announced on
television the country would cut domestic fuel sales by 30 pct.
A ministry statement had earlier announced indefinite
suspension of crude oil exports, declaring force majeure.
    Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a
television interviewer that it could possibly take more than a
month to repair Ecuador's main pipeline linking Amazon basin
oil fields to the Pacific Ocean coast.
    The quake on Thursday, which registered six on the 12-point
Mercalli scale, killed at least six people and was centred near
the Reventador volcano about 90 km (50 miles) east of Quito.
    Ecuador had recently been pumping 260,000 barrels per day.
    The government's austerity measures ban the sale of
aviation fuel to foreign airliners on international routes and
no fuel will be available for ships owned by foreign lines.
    Ecuador also banned the sale of petrol on weekends and
holidays and limited sales on weekdays, an Energy and Mines
Ministry communique said.

<title>ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL</title>
<author>    By WALKER SIMON, REUTERS</author>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 9 - </dateline>The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil
shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at
least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.
    The official said Ecuador could resume exports after
repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links
jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.
It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,
the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35
days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.
    The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the
12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the
pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil
accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as
60 pct of government revenues.
    Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping
about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd
above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy
Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of
173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.
    However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,
costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian
pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take
about 60 days to build.
    Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,
had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end
of January, about equal to one month's imports.
    It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion
dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's
total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in
Latin America.
    In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would
loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three
months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.
    Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies
and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in
repayment in May, Lusinchi said.
    A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister
Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior
and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and
co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

<title>IRAN SELLING DISCOUNTED CRUDE, JAPAN TRADERS SAY</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 9 - </dateline>Japanese customers have bought nearly six
mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company
(NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, and
Western traders have received even larger discounts, Japanese
traders involved in the transactions told Reuters.
    NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese
customers with different formulas. One company has bought
800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of
30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.
    Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and
Dubai spot prices less a discount, they said.

    Iran's discounted sales have not, however, managed to
reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot
markets, oil traders said.
    Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder
weather in Europe, and reports that OPEC's February output was
below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day.
    Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullish
sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market
are supporting spot price levels, they said.

    Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price
but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a
discount, the sources said. ""It's just disguised cheating,"" one
Japanese trader said.
    The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the
official price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln
barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in
Singapore. They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have
been sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on the
official price and 40 pct on spot prices, or with part of the
price related to processing arrangements.

<title>PETRO-CANADA TO DRILL TWO TERRA NOVA TEST WELLS</title>
<dateline>    ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland, March 9 - </dateline>Petro-Canada, Canada's
state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation
wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore
Newfoundland.
    Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work
should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development
plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said.
    Depending on time required for regulatory approvals,
construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as
early as 1991, Petro-Canada said.
    ""We have a high degree of confidence that the western
portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln
cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels,
and that we could produce it economicly using a floating
production system,"" Petro-Canada said.
    The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St.
John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was
discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984.
    ""We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion of
the field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove up
additional reserves there,"" the company said.
    Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial
prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources
towards development so it can start generating a return on
investments, Petro-Canada said.
    Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells,
has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of
the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's East
Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field
participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd,
Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium
Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX.
    Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field's
Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil,
company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgary
office.
    Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's East
Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels,
he added.
    Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs
to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the
development budget could double if the company builds a
production system combining both blocks in the field, he said.
    Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block
would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily
production, with a production system that would have maximum
capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in
answer to a query.
    The company estimates a production system combining both
Graven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field could
produce about 45,000 bpd average daily production, he said.

    ""No action should be ruled out--import fees or quotas,

     Currently, some 700 oil rigs are operating in the U.S.,
down sharply after oil prices slipped from 30 dlrs in late 1985
to around 10 dlrs in 1986. Prices are now around 18 dlrs. The
highest number of working rigs was 4,500 in December 1981.

<dateline>    ABU DHABI, March 11 - </dateline>Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza
Aqazadeh is in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to discuss oil
prices and the general market situation, Iranian officials
accompanying him said.
    He will meet UAE President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan
al-Nahayan and Oil Minister Mana Said al-Oteiba.
    Aqazadeh arrived last night after a brief stopover in
Riyadh, where he met Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Hisham Nazir.
    The official Saudi Press Agency quoted him as saying his
talks at Riyadh with Nazir had been constructive and good.
    Aqazadeh said Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) members were agreed on holding production stable and he
reiterated the importance of maintaining oil prices.
    OPEC members agreed in December to limit production to 15.8
mln barrels per day for the first half of this year and on a
benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.
    Aqazadeh also visted OPEC members Gabon, Algeria and Libya.
The Iranian news agency, IRNA, quoted him as saying before
leaving Tripoli that OPEC should do everything possible to make
oil prices permanently stable.

<title>SAUDI ARABIA'S KING FAHD WANTS STABLE OIL PRICES</title>
<author>    By STEPHEN JUKES AND PHILIP SHEHADI, REUTERS</author>
<dateline>    RIYADH, March 11 - </dateline>King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wants
oil price stability and he called on non-OPEC producers to
avoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group.
    His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the television
news agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will make
to Britain later this month.
    King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared
to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln
barrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price
agreed to by OPEC last December.
    The King replied: ""Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by
itself but certainly desires price stability.""
    Non-OPEC countries ""must help us in a framework of common
interest so that there is no type of competition which could
prove harmful to everyone,"" he said.
    Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first
step towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was not
for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such
issues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher
benchmark.
    In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure,
due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahd
said Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, was
adhering to decisions made at OPEC's December conference which
set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987.
    A major non-OPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted the
group's pleas to curb its North Sea oil output.
    The King also urged the world community to help the
Palestinians return to their homeland and called for a peaceful
end to the Iran-Iraq war. The 6-1/2-year-old war could not be
resolved on the battlefield, he said.

<title>OIL FIRMS CUT 1987 INDONESIAN EXPLORATION SPENDING</title>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, March 11 - </dateline>Foreign oil companies will spend less
on exploration in Indonesia this year than last, budgeting 2.7
billion dlrs for calendar 1987 against 1986 spending of 2.8
billion dlrs, the state oil company Pertamina said.
    Actual spending last year fell short of the budgeted figure
of 3.2 billion dlrs, as oil companies slashed expenditure
because of the crash in world oil prices.
    Jumardi Jukardi, head of Pertamina's coordinating board for
foreign contractors, said foreign companies will drill 110
exploration wells and 431 development wells this year, against
108 and 330 last year.

<title>INDONESIA OIL CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS END THIS MONTH</title>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, March 11 - </dateline>Negotiations between Indonesia's state
oil company Pertamina and foreign oil contractors on extension
of the standard 30-year production sharing contract will be
concluded by the end of this month, a Pertamina official said.
    Jumardi Jukardi, head of Pertamina's foreign contractors
coordinating board, gave no details about the outcome of the
talks.
    But Pertamina President Abdul Rachman Ramly has said
priority will be given to extending contracts for companies
whose exploration and production contracts expire within the
next seven to 10 years.
    Jukardi, speaking to Indonesian reporters, said the
negotiations would determine whether the 85-15 production
sharing split in favour of Pertamina would be adhered to or
altered in some cases as oil companies are asking for.
    Hardjoko Seputro, spokesman for the Mines and Energy
Ministry, has said that President Suharto has agreed in
principle to extension of the standard 30-year production
sharing contract to reflect better current depressed conditions
on the international oil market.

<title>ECUADOR CRUDE OIL EXPORTS STOPPED FOR FIVE MONTHS</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 11 - </dateline>Ecuador needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the
damage to its oil export pipeline caused by last week""s
earthquake, which will stop crude exports for five months,
energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said.
    Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crude
from jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, would
be repaired with the help of Texaco Inc &lt;TX.N&gt; and a Mexican
and an Argentine firm.
    President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago that
Ecuador, an OPEC member, would have to suspend crude exports
for four months due to the quake.
    Oil traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of
Ecuador's total exports and as much as 60 pct of government
revenues.
    Deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said Ecuador
would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to
meet its needs until the line was repaired.
    The Ecuadorean minister at the Presidency, Patricio
Quevedo, told reporters that Venezuela will lend Ecuador five
mln barrels of crude, which would repaid in kind after a
180-day period.
    He added the Caracas-based Andean Development Corp had
granted a loan of 11.7 mln dlrs towards repairing the pipeline,
50 km of which had been damaged in the quake.
    In Quito, Foreign Minister Rafael Garcia Velasco yesterday
summoned ambassadors from about 40 countries to whom he issued
appeal for emergency aid for the country. Only three countries,
the U.S., Colombia and Venezuela, had offered assistance.

<title>TALKING POINT/OIL SERVICES TURNAROUND SEEN</title>
<author>    By Bernice Napach, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 11 - </dateline>The oil services industry is on the
verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil
industry analysts said.
    The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some
stocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the
second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the
first half, and continue into the next decade.
     ""People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go
up to start buying,"" said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc.
    Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB&gt;,
Halliburton Co &lt;HAL&gt;, Dresser Industries &lt;DI&gt;, Baker
International &lt;BKO&gt;, and McDermott International Inc &lt;MDR&gt;,
which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a
Dallas-based investor.
    Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing
exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in
oil services will begin in the U.S.
    ""Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up
faster,"" said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs.
    The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766
last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co
&lt;HT&gt; figures show.
    The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is
projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge,
vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. ""The
first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the
second half of 1988,"" Kerridge said.
    Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar
pattern, Kerridge said.
    ""Halliburton is the best value,"" said Jeffrey Freedman,
vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding
the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common
stock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess,
and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash
flow including debt.
    Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil service
stock.
    ""Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant
technical leader in the industry,"" Freedman said.
    ""Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring,
including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its
considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to
maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on
the project upturn in exploration and development activity,""
according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at
Robert W. Baird and Co Inc.
    Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25
cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts
in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87
billion dlrs.
    Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil
service companies and said choosing among them is difficult.
Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a
possible merger with Hughes Tool Co.
    Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery but
possibly not as much as other companies because it is not a
pure service company, Sweeney said.
    Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to cost
reductions and streamlined operations, including the sale and
leaseback of its headquarters, said Swarup.

<title>OPEC REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO FIXED PRICES, CEILING</title>
<author>    By James Jukwey, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LAGOS, March 11 - </dateline>OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to
fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an
overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to
defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said.
    He told a news conference here ""After due consultation with
my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria
and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold
the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various
quotas and official selling prices.""
    Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned.
    ""We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading
news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member
countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the
month of February,"" Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said.
    Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at
900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm
determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs
agreed upon last December in Geneva.
    The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for
OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed
prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs.
    Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but
fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more
than the agreed level.
    ""The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not
hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of
OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs,"" Lukman
said.
    He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based
on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, adding
that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000
bpd.
    Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement,
while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab
Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said.
    ""If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement
succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level
of 18 dlrs,"" the group's president said.
    He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting
formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely.
    ""Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is
at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in
December are being adhered to,"" he said.
    Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow
the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in
relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied ""We consider
the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials.""
    Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn
on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well
below this time last year and soon they would return to the
market in search of crude.
    ""We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in
maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,""
Lukman said.
    The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he
said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise
prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held
view not to do anything to help the market.
    ""We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with
two-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future is
ours. We will use that advantage responsibly,"" he said.
    Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's output
following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the
South American country would be allowed a higher output quota
when it recovered from the disaster.

&lt;Canadian Worldwide Energy Ltd&gt; affiliate's Lasmo et al
Tableland 4-36-2-10W2 well in Saskatchewan flowed 567 barrels
of 37 degree gravity oil through a 17/64 inch choke from depths
of 8,531 to 8,548 feet and 636 barrels of oil per day through a
20/64 inch choke from depths of 8,500 to 8,507 feet.
    Triton said because of the well's status as a deep

holiday under the Saskatchewan drilling incentive products.
    It said the well's initial production is expected to be
restricted to an allowable level of about 300 barrels a day,

<title>ECUADOR DEPUTY MINISTER SEEKS OIL AID IN VENEZUELA</title>
<dateline>    CARACAS, March 11 - </dateline>Ecuador's deputy energy minister
Fernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on
further Venezuelan assistance to his country's oil industry
following last week's earthquake, officials said.
    Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an
expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of
pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of
Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports.
    Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend
Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after
180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs.
    The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that
Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador's entire OPEC quota,
set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987.
    ""All options are open at this moment in the context of
cooperation on oil production,"" a Venezuelan energy and mines
ministry source said.
    Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to
compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the
pipeline is repaired, officials said.
    Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines
minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at
technical level, officials said.
    Industry sources said that among the options are for
Venezuela to produce Ecuador's entire quota, or for Venezuela
and non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply
Ecuador's Far Eastern clients.
    But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been
reached on the matter, and that an announcement would be made
in due course.
    Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have
to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its
needs until the line was repaired.
    Ecuador energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran
said last night his country needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the
damage to the export pipeline caused by the earthquake.

<title>ENERGY/FOREIGN INVESTORS</title>
<author>    By JULIE VORMAN, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, March 11 - </dateline>Lured by the weakening dollar and the
conviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, European
energy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reserves
to replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said.
    They said owning oil reserves in a politically stable
United States is good insurance against future shortages.
However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated up
competition among European firms, well-heeled U.S.
institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choice
domestic oil properties.
    Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil and
gas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyers
had helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. All
buyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs a
barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for
acquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and five
dlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm's research.
    ""Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, but
we're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in,"" said
Arthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist and
president of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn.
    ""Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil and
gas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,"" he added.
    Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe
the trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because
of the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception that
oil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to
buy new reserves than to explore for them.
    Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks to
the need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and
general restructuring throughout the oilpatch.
    In two of the biggest transactions of recent months,
French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of &lt;Total Compagnie
Francaise des Petroles&gt;, spent more than 230 mln dlrs to
separately acquire oil assets of Texas International &lt;TEICC&gt;
and Lear Petroleum Partners &lt;LPP&gt;. A spokesman for Minatome
said the company is searching for additional acquisitions.
    A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, &lt;Petrofina S.A.&gt;
and &lt;Cometra Oil S.A.&gt; paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy
virtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos &lt;WMB&gt;,
the Oklahoma pipeline firm.
    But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures
with experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan's
&lt;Nippon Oil&gt; is a partner of Texaco Inc's &lt;TX&gt; Texaco USA in a
100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined with
Dupont's &lt;DD&gt; Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal.
    Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, its
geographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are
more important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions
than relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula.
    Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representing
International Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of &lt;Preussag
Corp&gt; and &lt;C. Deilmann Inc&gt; of West Germany, said the firm had
earmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in
Texas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months.
    But he called that a small amount compared to the amount
other investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber's Geodyne
Energy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend up
to 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties.
    ""The competition is stiff, not only from other foreign
investors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oil
companies,"" he said. ""Our company is shopping around because we
feel it's substantially less risky than pure exploration. If
you're going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you need
prices higher than the current market,"" he added.
    In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokerage
houses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were also
competing for prime properties.
    Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group
&lt;RD&gt;, has been one of the most active companies in buying and
selling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquired
two billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels of
oil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said.
    ""Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of these
companies,"" Smith said. ""Domestic production has dropped by one
mln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may
drop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988.""

<title>BRAZIL'S SARNEY MEETS STRIKES WITH SHOW OF FORCE</title>
<author>    By Stephen Powell, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    SANTOS, BRAZIL, MARCH 11 - </dateline>With troops in place in Brazil's
ports and oil installations, the government of Prersident Jose
Sarney today sought to end a wave of labour unrest by a show of
force.
    Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supported
in some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries and
six areas of oil production.
    The state-oil company Petrobras requested the intervention
because of a threatened strike by 55,000 oil industry
employees.
    The government had already dispatched more than 1,000
marines to occupy the country's main ports after a national
seamen's strike was ruled illegal last Friday.
    The strike by 40,000 seamen, now in its 13th day,
represents a stern challenge to the government.
    The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazil
desperately needs foreign exchange.
    It was a deterioration in the country's trade balance which
precipitated Brazil's current debt crisis and the decision on
February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
commercial debt.
    There was no sign today of an early end to the seamen's
strike, which has badly hit the port of Santos -- the most
important in South America -- and the country's other main
ports.
    Small groups of marines armed with submachineguns stand on
the quays near the strike-bound ships, but the military
presence here is generally discreet.
    A total of 800 marines are inside the docks but most are
out of sight.
    Yesterday marines and police occupied one ship, the
Docemarte, seamen's leaders said. After explaining to the
captain that the strikers faced up to one year in jail because
the strike was illegal, the men returned to work.
    One of the strike leaders, Elmano Barbosa, said ""it is a
psychological war. They are using force and we are using
peaceful methods.""
    Port sources said only two Brazilian ships in Santos, the
Docemarte and the Henrique Leal, were working.
    At the seamen's national strike headquarters in Rio de
Janeiro, spokesmen say a total of about 190 ships are
strike-bound in Brazil and in foreign ports.
    Contradicting earlier reports from strike headquarters in
Rio de Janeiro, seamen in Santos said the strikers on board
ships here were not running out of food.
    The current labour unrest is the worst faced by Sarney's
civilian government since it came to power two years ago.
    Yesterday, in a separate protest, hundreds of thousands of
farmers held rallies directed largely against high bank
interest rates.
    The current rash of labour unrest in industry and
agriculture stems from the failure of the government's
now-collapsed Cruzado Plan price freeze.

<title>USX &lt;X&gt; PROVED OIL, GAS RESERVES FALL IN 1986</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 11 - </dateline>USX Corp said proved reserves of oil
and natural gas liquids fell 28 pct to 802.8 mln barrels at the
end of 1986 from 1.12 billion barrels at year-end 1985.
    The figures, in USX's just-released 1986 annual report,
indicate much of the drop resulted from the exclusion of 293.7
mln barrels of Libyan reserves, after the U.S. government last
June directed U.S. oil companies to end Libyan operations.
    USX, which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp,
had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 14.94 billion dlrs from its oil
and gas operations.
    About 24 pct of total sales came from USX's USS steel unit
and 16 pct from diversified businesses, which include oilfield
services, raw materials, minerals, chemicals and real estate.
    According to the report, domestic liquids reserves fell
slightly to 628.5 mln barrels from 628.9 mln and foreign
reserves fell to 174.3 mln from 486.4 mln barrels. The large
drop in foreign reserves was in the Middle East and Africa,
where they fell to about 9.3 mln barrels from 316.7 mln,
reflecting the exclusion of Libya.
    Total natural gas reserves fell to 4.82 trillion cubic feet
at year-end 1986 from 5.18 trillion at the end of 1985.
    Again, most of the drop came from the Middle East and
Africa, where reserves fell to zero from 71.9 billion cubic
feet, excluding Libyan reserves.
    U.S. natural gas reserves fell to 3.44 trillion cubic feet
from 3.65 trillion and foreign reserves fell to 1.38 trillion
from 1.53 trillion.
    In other areas, USX said total capital spending fell to 962
mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.78 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986
audited figure is eight mln dlrs higher than the unaudited
figure the company reported on Jan 27.
    USX also said it expects to record a gain of 150 mln dlrs
in 1988, representing 50 pct of previously existing investment
tax credits allowable under the new tax law. The loss of the
other half of the credits was reflected in the fourth quarter.
    In a discussion of steel results, USX said plants that were
shut down last month and some previously idled plants may be
permanently closed. USX took a fourth quarter charge of 1.03
billion dlrs to restructure its steel operations. The charge
included the ""indefinite idling"" last month of four plants in
Utah, Pennsylvania and Texas.
    Other plants or parts of plants in Pennsylvania, Indiana,
Alabama, Ohio and Chicago had been previously idled.
    ""These operations are not permanently shut down. Improved
market conditions for the products from these plants may make
it feasible to reopen some of them,"" USX said in the report.
    ""On the other hand, a lack of any future market improvement
may necessitate their permanent closing,"" it added.

<title>VENEZUELA TO LEND OIL TO ECUADOR FOR EXPORT</title>
<dateline>    Caracas, march 11 - </dateline>venezuela will supply ecuador with an
as yet undetermined amount of crude oil to help it meet export
commitments, seriously affected by last week's earthquake,
energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti said.
    He gave few details about the deal, but said a crude oil
loan agreement will be made between state oil companies
petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa) and ecuador's cepe.
    Ecuador was forced to suspend oil exports for an expected
four months after an earthquake damaged a pipeline. Oil
accounts for 60 per cent of its export income.
     Hernandez was speaking to reporters at miraflores palace
on the results of talks with ecuador's deputy energy minister
fernando santos alvite, who arrived here last night.
    ""the volume lent to ecuador would be discounted from its
opec quota and would not affect venezuela's,"" he said. ""we would
from august on produce our own quota and sell the additional
amounts that ecuador would be repaying us,"" he said.
    He did not elaborate on the quota arrangements but did say
ecuador would notify opec by telex that venezuela would be
lending it a certain amount over so many days.
    Venezuela's opec output quota is currently 1.495 million
barrels a day, and ecuador's has been set at 210,000 bpd.

    Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss
an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached.
    The additional output would be related to plans now under
discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while

<title>MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS</title>
<author>    By Jennie Kantyka, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 12 - </dateline>Most Japanese companies have decided not
to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot
prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels,
industry sources said.
    They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai
traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its
official price of 17.42 dlrs.
    Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for
Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said.
    The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a
total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude
under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in
the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd.
    They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts
on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts
depended largely on the levels of spot prices.
    ""If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would
probably buy Iranian crude at the official price,"" one Japanese
refiner said.
    ""We don't intend to put pressure on them,"" he added.
    Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil
at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are
considerably lower, oil traders said.
    They said if spot prices move higher there will be no
problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices.
Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after
finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is
likely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus.
    The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from
OPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to the
fixed prices.
    But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to
its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand
would be balanced by the end of the second quarter.
    They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure
based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations
should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and
a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend.
    One Japanese refiner said, ""At the moment there's a lot of
pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out
there will be no problem, and I'm beginning to trust their
ability.""
    Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman
told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, ""Nigeria and all
member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the
December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas
and official selling prices.""
    He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks
of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels
well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon
return to the market in search of crude.
    A Japanese refiner said, ""The European and U.S. Markets are
beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky.""

<title>SAUDI OUTPUT SAID AT YEAR LOW TO HELP OPEC</title>
<author>    By Philip Shehadi, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    RIYADH, March 12 - </dateline>Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen to
its lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence of
the kingdom's determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a
barrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sources
said.
    They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March
averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the
neutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February average
of 3.5 mln bpd.
    They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude
oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be
counted towards a member's production quota. Saudi Arabia's
quota is 4.133 mln bpd.
    The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the
world""s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec
official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the
sources said.
    King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview with
Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi
commitment to OPEC's December pact to boost oil prices to an
average 18 dlrs.
    ""Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions,"" he
said.
    The sources said the kingdom's exports from Gulf ports
averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday,
down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd.
    They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate
with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain
artificially high levels by putting oil into storage.
    The kingdom's main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with
past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon,
Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the
timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay
official prices, the sources said.
    Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but
still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed
liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said.
    They expected low early March output to pick up towards the
end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual
obligations.

<title>WILDLIFE UNIT PROPOSES ALASKA REFUGE OIL STUDY</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </dateline>The National Wildlife Federation 
rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wilderness
lands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration.
    The federation, the nation's largest conservation group,
said further study was needed to assess any possible damage
that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the
coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
    Jay Hair, the federation's executive vice president, called
the Interior's research into the effects of development ""so
fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on
which to make a public policy decision.""
    Hair called the department's proposal a ""reflection of a
largely political decision,"" adding ""we have no confidence in
Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area.""
    Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain
to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough 
safeguards to protect the area's caribou and musk-oxen.
    It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold
billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as
an energy resource would never be known without exploration.
    Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10
billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain.
    Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas
exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a
wildlife refuge protected from commercial development.
    Hair said Interior's report failed to stress the
probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct.
    He said Interior's study also failed to weigh oil, gas,
fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered
nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection
Agency on the possible effects of exploration.
    The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a
nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the
issue and report back to Congress in about two years.
    Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible
exploration of oil, only that Interior's study was inadquate to
make a sound judgement.
    Congressional observers said that at present there was
little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for
commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the
United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil.

    It also said that Shell Canada exercised its option to take

facility. It said the Shell Canada 7,500 barrel per day oil
sands project will be built on Shell's oil sand lease about 40

    PDVSA and Union Pacific will each contribute half the
capital required by the venture and arrange a revolving credit
facility with U.S. and foreign banks to finance inventories and
receivables, Union Pacific said.
    Petroles de Venezuela also signed a 25-year agreement to
supply at least 140,000 bpd of Venezulean crude oil and naphtha
to the refinery at market related prices.
    Under various options the in the agreement PDVSA could

    ""This will provide a stable, long-term supply to the
refinery at competitive costs, thereby assuring the economic
viability of the plant,"" a statement issued by Union Pacific
said.
   The statement said the agreement with PDVSA will enable the
company to supply a steady flow of refined products to its

<dateline>    LONDON, March 12 - </dateline>Selm-Societa Energia Montedison is to
close its Priolo crude refining units from March 15th to March
28th for maintenance, a company spokesman said.
    Throughput at the refinery is currently estimated at
140-150,000 bpd, although total capacity is nearer 200,000 bpd.
    Several other Mediterranean refineries are currently
shutdown for maintenance, most of which were scheduled some
months ago. But industry sources said that shutdowns may have
been rearranged to avoid running negative-netback crude.
     Tighter availabilities of products as a result of the 
shutdowns in the Med is helping to keep products markets
bullish, particularly for March deliveries, oil traders said.
    Garrone's refinery at San Quirico (capacity 130,000 bpd) is
due to shutdown on March 14th for three weeks, and the
jointly-owned ISAB/Garrone refinery at Mellili, capacity
220,000 bpd, is due to start up around March 20-25th following
its closure for maintenance a month ago, a company spokesman
said.
    The Esso Italiana refineries at Augusta and Siracusa will
not be closing this spring, a spokesman for the company said.
    In France, the distillation unit at Societe Francaise de
BP's Lavera refinery has been closed for maintenance since
March 2, and is due to restart early April. Total capacity is
181,900 bpd. It is currently operating at around 50 pct
capacity, a company spokesman said.
    Shell Francaise's Berre l'Etang refinery will shut down in
early April until mid-June, a company spokesman said. Capacity
is around 150,000 bpd. Compagnie Francaise de Raffinage (CFR)
will close the visbreaker at its La Mede refinery in early
April, but would not affect crude throughput at the refinery, a
company spokesman said. Current capacity is 136,000 bbl/day.
    Despite current bullish sentiment in the Med, however,
traders noted that crude netbacks are beginning to look more
attractive, and most maintenance shutdowns should be finished
in two to three weeks.
    As a result, oil industry sources suggest that the
situation may ease by mid-April.

<title>BRAZIL CANCELS OIL PURCHASE FROM SAUDI ARABIA</title>
<dateline>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 12 - </dateline>Brazil's state-oil company,
Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi
Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees
from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said.
    Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the
Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such
conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of
its commercial debts last month.
    The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil
consumption in Brazil.
    But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and
decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras
will lift the order to cancel the shipment.
    Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms by
Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere.
    ""Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since
1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much
better for us, because with the market prices more or less the
same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage,"" he said.
    Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing
Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing
from Brazil, he said.
    Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry
workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras
oil stocks are ""reasonably balanced."" 
    Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with
an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000
bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.
    ""If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, I
am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers

<title>VENEZUELA TO LEND ECUADOR 50,000 BPD OF CRUDE</title>

barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to help
it meet its export commitments, Energy and Mines Minister
Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said today.
    He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a
visit here this week by Ecuador's Deputy Energy Minister
Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in
August.
    Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to
offsetting the loss of Ecuador's 140,000 in exports caused by
earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week.
    Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline
connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao
was put out of action.
    Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador's
is 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to
allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the
pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses.
    Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrels
shipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this
weekend to help meet domestic consumption needs.
    The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by
Venezuela, will be processed at Guayaquil refineries.

country would have ground to a halt,"" he said.

billion dlrs spent in 1986.
    ""Overall capital and exploration expenditures will fall
slightly below the level for 1986 although we'll be ready to
increase spending whenever the outlook becomes more promising,""
Murray said.
    Mobil data in the annual report shows capital expenditures
have been cut every year since 1984's 3.6 billion dlrs to 3.5
billion dlrs in 1985.
    Murray told shareholders that despite the cuts ""the company
has promising acreage to explore as well as major oil and gas
reserves to develop in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Africa and
Indonesia.
    Over the past two weeks Mobil has announced restructuring
of its domestic exploration and development organization and
this week a restructuring of its oil services units, which
support the new affiliate.
    ""Mobil's chairman has explained this change by saying we
need a leaner organization to get more efficient usage from our
assets,"" said John Lord, a Mobil Corp spokesman.
    Murray said in announcing the first reorganization, which
will combine its current three exploration and producing
affiliates into one organization, Mobil Exploration and
Production U.S. Inc, that it is more effective than the present
organization and will improve the company's upstream
competitive position.
    Yesterday the company said that it will restructure its
Mobil Exploration and Producing Services Inc, MEPSI, to enhance
the development and transfer of technology supporting critical
areas of exploration, drilling, resevoir management and
computer systems.
    Earnings from Mobil's upstream operations in 1986 were 827
mln dlrs, down 54 pct from the previous year's 1.8 billion dlrs
in earnings.
    Mobil's strategy in the exploration and production sector
will be to give most attention to exploration possibilities
with the greatest long term potential, the company said.
    In its annual report, Mobil said that this will include
greater emphasis on ""frontier plays that, although riskier, fit
our strengths of technology and size...This probably also means
a shift toward emphasis in the foreign area since selective
overseas exploration offers greater potential.""

<title>BRAZILIAN TROOPS TO LEAVE OIL REFINERIES</title>
<author>    By Stephen Powell, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    SAO PAULO, MARCH 13 - </dateline>Brazil's labour troubles eased a
little today as the authorities announced they were withdrawing
troops from the country's main oil installations occupied three
days ago.
    The troops went in at the request of the state-oil company
Petrobras because of the threat of a strike by 55,000 oil
industry employees.
    Petrobras said in a statement today it had requested the
withdrawal of the troops. The situation in the refineries was
calm, it said, and the employees had indicated their
willingness to negotiate a pay deal.
    A national seamen's strike, however, continued and marines
remained in the country's main ports. The marines were
despatched to the ports after the seamen's strike, now two
weeks old, was ruled illegal last Friday.
    A spokesman at the national strike headquarters in Rio de
Janeiro said today a total of l63 ships were strike-bound, 135
in Brazil and 28 in foreign ports.
    Yesterday two small companies specialised in the transport
of chemicals, Global and Flumar, struck a pay accord with their
seamen who have secured a 120 pct increase.
    Brazilian newspapers today hailed these agreements as a
sign that the national strike could soon come to an end.
    Both companies employ fewer than 200 seamen and union
leaders said the vast majority of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were
still on strike.
    The threat of a stoppage by oil industry employees appeared
today to be receding. Petrobras said in its statement that the
company would meet union leaders for pay talks in Rio de
Janeiro next Wednesday.
    Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto would act as a mediator.
    Besides industrial troubles, there has also been
considerable unrest this week in the agricultural sector.
    On Tuesday hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies
throughout the country to protest against high interest rates.
    Television reports showed some of these protests still
continuing today, with farmers blockading banks with their
vehicles in several towns in the states of Sao Paulo and
Parana.
    The strikes in Brazil come as the government is trying to
extricate itself from a serious debt crisis brought on by a
deterioration in its trade balance.
    On February 20 President Jose Sarney announced that Brazil
was suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt to
private banks.
    Because of the seamen strike exports are being delayed and
the country is losing badly needed foreign exchange.

<title>ECUADOR BEGINS WORK ON OIL PIPELINE TO COLOMBIA</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 13 - </dateline>Construction workers today began building
a 26 km (16 mile) pipeline to link Ecuador's jungle oilfields
to a pipeline in Colombia through which Ecuadorean crude could
be pumped to the Pacific Coast, Ecuadorean energy minsitry
officials said.
    They said it would take about two months and at least 15
mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador to
Puerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombian
pipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia's
Pacific Ocean coast.
    The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed to
transport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) of
Ecuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said.
    The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room for
Ecuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about
17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadorean
energy ministry official said.
    The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped by
boat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domestic
demand.
    The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador to
resume some of production, paralysed since March six by an 
earthquake the night before.
    The tremor ruptured the country's main pipeline from jungle
oilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the Pacific
Ocean.
    Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before the
earthquake. It would take about five months to repair the
pipeline to Balao, government officials said.
    Ecuador estimates that it will cost between 145 to 150 mln
dlrs to repair oil installations damaged by the earthquake,

mln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitments
and its domestic energy demand, Ecuadorean Energy and Mines
Minister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement.
    Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline
connecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of
Balao was damaged last week by an earthquake.
    Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for a
total of up to to 7.5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet export

and provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador, he said.
     Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed its
exports after repairing its pipeline to Balao, a task that
would take an estimated five  months.
    Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for
refining in this country to meet domestic demand. Ecuador would
repay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired.
    Both countries are the only Latin American members of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

    The shipment is part contract signed in February for the

<title>SAUDI ARABIA DECIDES TO ACCEPT BRAZIL CREDIT</title>
<dateline>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 13 - </dateline>Saudi Arabia has lifted the
condition it imposed on the sale of oil to Brazil and will
accept Banco do Brasil's credit guarantees, state-oil company
Petrobras said in a statement.
    Petrobras cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from
the Saudis yesterday, after they refused to accept a letter of
credit from the Bank of Brazil, demanding guarantees from
leading international banks.
    It advised the Saudis the company would negotiate oil
purchases elsewhere unless they changed their mind by Monday.
    The 2.2 mln barrels shipment will be made by the Saudis on
March 24 as scheduled, the statement said.
    Under a 125,000 bpd contract signed in February the Saudis
agreed to supply oil to Brazil until June.

<title>BRAZILIAN BANK WORKERS DECIDE ON NATIONAL STRIKE</title>
<dateline>    CAMPINAS, Brazil, March 15 - </dateline>Brazilian bank workers voted
to launch a nationwide strike this month, compounding labour
unrest arising from the failure of the government's
anti-inflation plan.
    At a rally in this city, about 100 km northwest of Sao
Paulo, about 5,000 bank workers voted to strike on March 24
unless their demand for 100 pct pay rises is met.
    Wilson Gomes de Moura, president of the national
confederation which groups the bank employees' 152 unions
representing 700,000 workers, told Reuters the indefinite
stoppage would affect all banks.
    The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third
week and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against the
state-owned petroleum company Petrobras.
    The government ordered thousands of troops into the
refineries on Tuesday to forestall any occupation, but the
troops were removed yesterday.
    Petrobras said it had requested their withdrawal because
the refineries were calm and oil workers had indicated their
willingess to negotiate next Wednesday. The government has also
sent marines into the main ports.
    A spokesman at strike headquarters for the seamen in Rio de
Janeiro said unions were studying an offer by private
shipowners for a 120 pct pay rise.
    Seamen employed by two small companies have already
accepted a 120 pct pay rise and returned to work, as have about
5,000 seamen employed by Petrobras.
    Last week also saw widespread protests by hundreds of
thousands of farmers over what they see as unfairly high
interest rates charged by banks.
    According to official estimates, prices rose by more than
33 pct in the first two months of this year.

</title>Blah blah blah.

"<text>
<title>SAUDI OIL MINISTER SEES NO NEED TO ALTER OPEC PACT</title>
<author>    By Philip Shehadi, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    RIYADH, March 15 - </dateline>Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
said OPEC's December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18
dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there
was no immediate need to change it.
    Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news
agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three
mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC
quota.
    Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will
continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members
adhere to the pact, Nazer said.
    The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production
ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices
averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.
    Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki
Yamani last October, said: ""I do not foresee any need for new
measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting
will take place as scheduled.""
    Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all
members were abiding by its agreements.
    ""We've heard news every now and then of violations but they
were not at all verified,"" he said.
    OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a
13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near
18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.
    Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but
have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as
traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.
    Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its
4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.
    ""As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as
devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to
the agreement,"" he said.
    Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the
Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating
storage, Nazer said.
    King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and
Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price
stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful
competition with OPEC.
    ""Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly
desires price stability,"" he said.
    Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had
returned to a role of ""swing producer"" within OPEC.
    Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln
bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and
over-production by some OPEC states.
    ""Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played
by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8
mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other
members of OPEC,"" Nazer said.
    Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third
quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.
    But he said if circumstances changed ""I am sure then the
OPEC members will consult with each other and take the
necessary measures.""
    Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when
demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern
hemisphere spring and summer.
    Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation
from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union
agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after
he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.
    ""We did not ask any country to do anything. These were
programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market
conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing
conditions,"" Nazer said.
    He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate
-- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if
they saw fit.

<title>SAUDI BUSINESSMEN TO DISCUSS PRIVATE SECTOR</title>
<author>    By Stephen Jukes, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    ABHA, Saudi Arabia, March 15 - </dateline>Saudi Arabian business
leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out
problems facing the private sector of the kingdom's
oil-dependent economy.
    The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi
Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and
commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices.
    The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the
mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea,
has been organised by Saudi Arabia's chambers of commerce.
    Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce
Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day.
    Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air
problems facing commerce and industry after last year's slide
in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in
a private sector sorely short of finance.
    Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia,
the world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster private
enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy.
    The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle
East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing
and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans.
    Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord
reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost
prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel.
    With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the
turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a
52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down
foreign reserves.
    The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of
confidence to the business community.
    Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last
November, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the
number of new non-performing loans.
    But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate
finance manager in Riyadh said: ""Banks are still reluctant to
lend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am
not sure if it is firmly based.""
    Some businessmen and bankers point out that government
spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy
may still be contracting.
    Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply.
A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the
budget said: ""While industrialisation has continued to be one of
the government's highest priorities, the recession, the
payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi
and foreign investor interest in industry.""
    It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a
major issue among the businessmen gathered here.
    Official figures show the number of new licences for
industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March
1986, compared with the same period in 1985.
    Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major
source of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983.
    Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge
inventories of construction equipment as recession bit.
    Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories.
Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reached
agreement with bankers to extend debt repayments.
    The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels
conglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled a
draft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of
bank debt.
    Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely
to discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms to
step up investment in the kingdom.
    A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after
holding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi
outlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft
worth five billion stg.

<title>MEES SAYS SECOND WEEK MARCH OPEC OUTPUT 14 MLN BPD</title>
<dateline>    NICOSIA, March 16 - </dateline>OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd of
oil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below its
ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and
Ecuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated.
    A landslide breached Iraq's one mln bpd pipeline through
Turkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador have
shut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador
has an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd.
    MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first
week of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition to
output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
    MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of
its total production into floating storage.
    Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the
television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output,
including Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd.
    The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan
oil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with
its 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower
than that.
    It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially
stopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March
because Libya was insisting on official prices, but is still
lifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a
further 25,000 bpd of ""purchase crude.""
    It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only
2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not lift
at official prices.
    MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member
countries calling for the formation of a committee to study
what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among
various members.
    The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was
having difficulty selling crude at official prices.
    The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries
export substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC
price regulations -- exports of refined products, equity crude
on which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and
""other forms of hydrocarbons"" which are marketed in package deals
with crude oil.

<title>ECUADOR SAYS IT WILL PAY DEBT WHEN IT CAN</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 16 - </dateline>President Leon Febres Cordero said
Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make
payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have
to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments.
    Ecuador said on Friday that last week's earthquake was
forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the
slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to
private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16
billion dlr foreign debt.
    ""All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour,"" the
president said during a visit to the quake zone. ""A government
as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain.""
    Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil
would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able
to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.
    He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17
dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs
a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.
    Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a
price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the
earthquake, which killed at least 300 people.
    Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget would
be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and
salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet,
would be reduced.
    He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic
consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of
gasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares
would rise by 20 pct. Gasoline supplies would also be limited.

<title>PARIBAS SEEKING TO ADJUST ECUADOR OIL FACILITY</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 16 - </dateline>Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220
mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports,
wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country
recover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said.
    But the French bank's plan, which would effectively
postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several
months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52
members of the loan syndicate.
    The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports was
ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months
to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair.
    President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total
damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that
Ecuador as a result would maintain January's suspension of
interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt.
    Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the
price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador's
export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue.
    Although sympathetic to Ecuador's plight, many banks in the
Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job
for international financial organizations and not for
commercial banks, bankers said.
    The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last
October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a
Latin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted in
August 1982.
    Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly
that the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they
fear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions
for Latin borrowers will be set back.
    ""There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel
it's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a
restructuring would look bad,"" one banker commented.

down tomorrow to start drafting a fiscal 1988 budget, with the
budget writers expected to look at several proposals for fuel
taxes and other tax options to cut the budget.
    In a briefing book for the drafting sessions, a number of
revenue raising tax options are proposed, including a five dlrs
a barrel fee on domestic and imported oil, a fee just on
imported oil, and a broad based tax on domestic energy
consumption based on five pct of value.
    Other proposals include various excise taxes and
combinations of import surcharges or tariffs, including a 10

22 billion dlrs next year alone, more in later years.
    The committee, however, will only include revenue numbers
in its proposed budget with the actual revenue decisions left
to the House and Senate tax-writing committees.
     The committee will draft a budget which its chairman, Sen

<title>STUDY PREDICTS U.S. DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </dateline>A government study has concluded the
U.S. Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into the
next century and must take steps to reduce its vulnerability,
the New York Times said.
    The newspaper said the inter-agency government study found
a serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily falling
domestic production and rising demand for imported oil.
    The study concluded that by 1995 the U.S. Will be relying
on foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil, more than the peak
of 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate during
the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.
    The U.S. Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs, up from
27 pct a year ago, the New York Times said.
    It said recommendations sent to the White House by Energy
Secretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raise
domestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from the
current 8.4 mln barrels.
    The newspaper said the administration has placed increased
emphasis on stockpiling oil reserves. It said the view now held
is that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in times
of shortages, should be increased by 100,000 barrels a day,
rather than 35,000 as called for in the 1988 budget.
   The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring the
depletion allowance to major producers.
    ""The administration also plans to renew its efforts to
...Repeal the windfall profits tax, remove bars to drilling on
the outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits the
use of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers,"" it added.
    The New York Times quoted Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma
as saying the study greatly underestimated potential U.S.
Demand for imported oil in the next decade and overestimated
the amount of domestic oil which would be produced.

today now that it is apparent that OPEC has succeeded in
holding to its prescribed production quotas.
    ""It is clear that OPEC, through jawboning and quota
restraint, will boost the price of oil,"" Margoshes said.
    Prices of oil stocks rose sharply today in response to
higher oil prices and optimism about OPEC quotas. Margoshes

Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD&gt;, 7/8 to 62-3/4, Exxon &lt;XON&gt; one to
83-1/8, and Chevron &lt;CHV&gt; 1-1/8 to 54-7/8.
    In addition, Margoshes said he recommended Atlantic
Richfield &lt;ARC&gt; on a short-term basis, though he said he is
still suspect about its debt situation. Atlantic Richfield rose
1-3/4 to 77.
    He said ""the market could come down to test the 16 dlr a
barrel level again, but the main thrust of investing in oil is
positive right now. Before the year is out we will see higher
oil prices.""
    He noted that belief that the government is interested in
raising the strategic reserves is factored into the rise in oil
stocks today.

<title>EXXON &lt;XON&gt; MAY CLOSE ONE FRENCH REFINERY</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, MARCH 17 - </dateline>Exxon Corp, the world's largest oil
company, said in a published interview today that it was
reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to
close on of its french refineries.
    Lee R. Raymond, Exxon's new president, singled out the
possibility of a closure of one of Exxon's refineries in France
during the interview.
    An Exxon spokeswoman confirmed that Raymond had
specifically mentioned refineries in France but said that no
specific refinery had been named. She also said that all of
Exxon's opertations were under constant review.
    Exxon currently has two refineries in France, FOS in the
mediterranean with a capcity of 175,000 barrels per day and
Port Jerome west of paris with a similar capacity.
    Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an influential trade
journal, said, in its current issue, that they understood that
Exxon was looking at the possibility of refinery closures in
Antwerp, Southern France or possibly Italy.
    Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers inc said
that with the closures Exxon made in 1986 in Europe and the
improvement in the European refining situation, its future
profits there should be good.
    ""Exxon and other major oil companies have closed a bunch of
refineries in Europe, upgraded the rest and shaken many of the
indepedents out of the market. Now with demand for products
rising and efficient operations, Exxon should show superior
earnings,"" Mlotok said.
    ""Just after Royal Dutch &lt;RD&gt;, they are seen as one of the
highest grade refiners in Europe,"" he added.
    Industry sources said that the oil companies were likely to
feel greater pressure on their operations in Southern Europe
where competition from the OPEC countries is increasing as
these producers move further into downstream operations.
    PIW said that refiners in the Mediterranean can expect
increased shipments from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC export
refineries.
    PIW said ""sales from Libya, Algeria and elsewhere are
expected to reclaim markets lost to Italian and other European
refiners as a result of the abundance of cheap netback oil last
year.""

development expenditure on certain future oil fields against
Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT).
    To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on an
individual field itself, when its income stream began, but was
not immediately available against other development
expenditure, the statement said.
    The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern
basin for which development
consent is first given on or after today, and will improve the
post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies
to proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said.
    Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow
certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at
present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT
liability.
    This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the
U.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in a
particular field within three years of being incurred, to be
allowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the Inland
Revenue said.
    This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more
in line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned to
encourage general research into ways of reducing field
development costs, it said.
    In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mln
stg a year, it calculated.
    The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical
measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech.
    These included measures to allow companies to balance their
shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two
past periods of allowance utilisation.
    Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs
were announced, while there were also ammendments on rules on
corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the
so-called ""ring fence"" of activities in the U.K. And its
continental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for
the implementation of measures announced in November, it said.
    Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers
Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs
on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry.
    He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would
favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields
such Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward.
    Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields
might also be encouraged, he said.
    Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore
construction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs
under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year.
    He pointed out that the relief only applies to the
development of new fields outside the Southern Basin.
    This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the
central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than
in the south and thus have greater capital and labour
requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south.
    He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure
would help fundamental research in the oil industry, although
the benefits of this research would not be seen for several
year.

<title>U.S. WARNS OF DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </dateline>A White House-ordered report said 
that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000
could have potentially damaging implications for national
security.
    The Energy Department study discusses several options to
curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.
    President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled
out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help
the depressed domestic oil industry.
    Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that
""although we have made gains in energy security in the last six
years, this report shows that there is justification for
national concern both over declining competitiveness of our
domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.""
    The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.
consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.
    Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign
oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.
    President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a
determination that the country never again become captive to a
foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and
sharp prices increases of the 1970s.
    The report said an import fee would raise prices and help
make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new
oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would
depress the nation's economy.

<title>U.S OIL TAX WOULD NOT AFFECT PDVSA-CHAMPLIN DEAL</title>
<dateline>    Caracas, march 17 - </dateline>an eventual oil import fee in the
united states will make no difference to champlin petroleum
corp's joint venture agreement signed today with petroleos de
venezuela (pdvsa), champlin chairman william adams said.
    ""this was an aspect which was discussed at length during the
negotiations, but we can say our contract covers all
eventualities in this regard,"" he told reuters during the
signing ceremony here.
    Venezuela's energy and mines minister arturo hernandez
grisanti earlier described the agreement, under which pdvsa
buys 50 pct of champlin's corpus christi refinery, as ""one more
step in the maturation and presence of our oil industry in
world markets.""
   union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement will
be beneficial to both sides, combining a secure source of
supply with a modern refinery and access to markets.
    ""we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a time
of protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there are
clear benefits to both sides,"" he said.
    Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even with
an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over
the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan
heavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities and
obtain a competitive product yield.
    ""therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a
consideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seen
what such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impact
on today's agreement,"" adams said.
    He said the refinery could run crude as heavy as
venezuela's bolivar coastal field (bcf) 17 api without any
difficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier diet
to take advantage of bigger margins.
    The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110,000 bpd of
venezuelan high sulphur content heavy crude, with an 80-85 pct
yield of white products.

<title>HERRINGTON SAYS HE MAY CALL FOR OIL TAX BENEFITS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </dateline>Energy Secretary John Herrington
said he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oil
industry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and
head off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
    He said also at a news conference that he would recommend
to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels
per day.
    The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a

    Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate
for the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down
because of budgetary constraints.
    Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might
advocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax
benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and
development into new ways to extract oil which is now
considered uneconomical to produce.
    He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the
Energy Department's study on oil's impact on national security.
    Herrington said that before he disclosed what
recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry
he might make, he would raise the matter with the White House
Economic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase
oil production made good tax policy.
    He said he would like to increase U.S. production by one

<title>OPEC WANTS 18 DLR OIL PRICE - OAPEC OFFICIAL</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, March 17 - </dateline>OPEC believes world oil prices should
be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC
Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today.
    In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminar
in Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: ""OPEC believes
...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions
and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs.""
    But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had
caused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced to
curtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC
states could not be sustained in some cases.
    ""For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now
considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its member
countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing
production,"" Al-Wattari said.
    ""Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,""
Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures,
some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use
and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added.
    Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the
organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in
February, although this had meant sacrifices.
    The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability,
though restored to a good level, was still under pressure,
Al-Wattari said. ""A lasting stability in the world market
requires a wider scope of international cooperation,"" he added.
    He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a
political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC.
    But although cutbacks announced by these states were
politically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they were
insufficient in terms of volume, he added. ""The overall majority
of non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC's
calls for supply regulation,"" he said.
    Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it
allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to
continue, while not generating excessive cash flow for
otherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price
would no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added.
    Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, also
addressing the seminar, added that discipline was still needed
to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market.
    Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous
for both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperation
would ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue.

<dateline>    CARACAS, March 17 - </dateline>Venezuela has still to work out final
details of its plan to supply Ecuador with 50,000 barrels per
day of crude oil to compensate that country for lost exports
caused by earthquake damage, a senior Petroleos de Venezuela
(PDVSA) official said.
    ""We have yet to finalize details on how the compensation
will be carried out and how OPEC production quotas will be

    He said an agreement was initialled on a visit last week by
Ecuador's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite.
    He pointed out that there are some contractual points to be
considered. Venezuela, possibly unique among oil exporters,
requires its clients to sign final destination clauses to
ensure its oil is not resold on the spot market.
    Ecuador's oil minister Javier Espinosa was quoted today as
saying Venezuela will export the oil on Ecuador's account and
remit the revenues to Quito. Ecuador would pay back the oil at
a rate of 35,000 bpd.
    He said Venezuela's oil would be traded through Ecuadorean
state oil company Cepe, but the PDVSA official said the company
never allows third parties to trade its oil.

<title>U.K. OIL REVENUE FORECAST TO FALL IN 1987/88</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 17 - </dateline>The U.K. Government forecasts that oil
revenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year
1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in
1985/86.
    The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement and
Budget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament.
    The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15
dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oil
revenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining
close to current levels, the Treasury document said.
    The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall will
reflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporation
tax is paid after a time lag.
    The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference
in oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln
stg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a full
year.
    Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987,
according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes in
production would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88
and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added.
    Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are now
estimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the
1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts,
despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts.
    Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billion
stg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the
overshoot.
    Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to
168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items,
besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of
40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year.
    Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5
billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in
1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion,
compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion this
fiscal year.
    The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal
year is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised
164.9 billion in the current year.
    A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations' market and
overseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.9 billion stg in
1987/88, from this year's revised 4.1 billion, the Treasury
said.

<title>MALAYSIA TO CUT OIL OUTPUT FURTHER, TRADERS SAY</title>
<author>    By Yeoh May, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    SINGAPORE, March 18 - </dateline>Malaysia's state oil company Petronas
will cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) from
May 1, trade sources said.
    Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last
September to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest
cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level.
    Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its
10 pct production cutback until mid-1987.
    However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report
that Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to an
average 510,000 bpd in 1987.
    The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices
at 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit
further production cutbacks, the sources said.
    Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl
this year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said.
    Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to
the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced
Indonesian and Chinese crude output.
    The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as
there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due
to the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said.
    In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering two
to three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month
for sale through tender, the sources said.
    However, this practice is likely to dwindle given the
reduced scale of production, they said.

<title>U.S ENERGY SECRETARY PROPOSES OIL TAX INCENTIVES</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </dateline>Energy Secretary John Herrington
said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil
and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan
Administration for consideration.
    ""These options boost production, while avoiding the huge
costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee,""
Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. ""It is my
intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy
council and the cabinet for consideration and review.""
    He said proposals, including an increase in the oil
depletion allowance and repeal of the windfall profits tax,
should be revenue neutral and promote domestic production at
the least cost to the economy and the taxpayers.
    ""The goal of the Administration policies is to increase
domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels
a year.""
    The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday
warning the United States was threatened by a growing
dependence on oil imports.
    ""We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65
pct by 1995,"" Herrington said.
    He said it was too soon to say what the Administration
policy on oil tax incentives would be and indicated there would
be opposition to tax changes.
    ""Of course, to move forward with these kinds of options
would require reopening tax issues settled last year (in the
tax reform bill) -- an approach which has not, in general, been
favored by the administration. I think what we need is to
debate this within the Administration,"" he said.
    He said the proposals might raise gasoline prices.
    Herrington did not specifically confirm a report in today's
Washington Post that he had written to President Reagan urging
an increase in the oil depletion allowance.
    Asked about the report by subcommittee members, Herrington
said various proposals were under consideration and would be

<title>ENERGY/DRILLING INDUSTRY</title>
<author>    BY JULIE VORMAN, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, March 18 - </dateline>The drastic cutbacks in U.S. drilling
last year are rapidly deflating the United State's natural gas
bubble, which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next
winter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch, industry analysts
said.
    Faltering deliverability of natural gas, a commodity that
is difficult and costly to import in large quantities, could
more than double the current U.S. rig count to near 2,000 by
1990, some analysts said.
    The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities
and big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of
activity in the Gulf of Mexico's offshore waters where some of
the nation's largest gas reserves are located.
    ""We think an upturn in U.S. drilling is imminent,"" said
James Crandall, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. ""Many
companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling
because they're betting that the gas market will be back in
balance in a year or two.""
    The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news
for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely
survived last year's plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a
barrel to less than half that. Today's relatively stable oil
prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a
return to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rig
count soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield
roustabouts commanded premium wages.
    The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT&gt; rig count, a
barometer of the oil industry's health, showed 761 U.S. rigs
active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year.
    In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but
dived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil
prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times.
    Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said ""In 1986, the United
States replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that
replacement rate won't be any better this year.""
    He added, ""We don't have the options we do with oil.
Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and
importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible
in the next 10 years because of the cost.""
    Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves
were discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16
trillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates.
    George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co
agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a
new cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling.
    ""We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to
dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990
supplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no later
than mid-1988,"" Gaspar said.
    Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that
could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count
to peak near 2,000 in December of 1989.
    Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be
conducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where
federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the
government unless drilling begins in the next two or three
years. Some of the industry's biggest companies, such as Exxon
Corp &lt;XON&gt;, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum have
already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later
this year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said.
    For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont &lt;DD&gt; subsidiary, will
spend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico's deepest
production platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of
gas per day.
    But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas and
Kansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership &lt;MLP&gt; in
recent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry is
on the verge of a recovery.
    Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below
600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do.
    ""The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets
above 30 dlrs a barrel,"" said Pickens, 58, adding he did not
expect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime.
    Tenneco Inc &lt;TGT&gt;, one of the largest U.S. gas producers,
is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists.
    Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect
significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s
when the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to about
seven years' supply. Current spot market prices of about 1.50
dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three
dlrs to spur reserve replacement, he said.

<title>U.S. ENERGY INDUSTRY SAID IN BETTER HEALTH</title>
<author>     By PETER ELSWORTH, Reuters</author>
<dateline>     DALLAS, March 18 - </dateline>The U.S. oil and gas industry is in
better health than it was a year ago, according to testimony
given to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state of
the industry hearing today.
     The Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gas
industry, heard testimony from a number of high-level company
executives reflecting a belief that the recent industry
downturn had bottomed out.
     ""The attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal
more optimistic (than last year),"" Commissioner James E. (Jim)
Nugent told Reuters.
     ""It reflects their (the executives) belief that they are
seeing the bottom of the economic cycle,"" he added, ""and with
just a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move
again.""
     The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil
prices, which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to
as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Prices have since steadied to
around 18 dlrs a barrel.
     At the same time, a number of company executives testified
that the nation's domestic exploration and production segment
was still hurting and in need of government help.
     Production costs are considerably higher in the United
States than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell
many domestic producers were forced to shut down their
operations. Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigs
operating in the United States compared with an average of
nearly 2,000 in 1985.
     Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of
Energy, many said the falling production of domestic oil
coupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growing
dependency on imports, particularly from the politically
volatile Middle East.
     ""In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lower
prices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day
(bpd),"" said J.S. Simon, General Manager of the Supply
Department at Exxon Corp &lt;XON&gt;, the nation's largest oil
company.
     At the same time, Simon said ""U.S. oil production declined
by 300,000 bpd, the first decline in several years,"" and ""net
petroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd.""
     Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain
between 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel, depending on OPEC's ability to
control production, Simon said demand is expected to remain at
1986 levels, leading to ""a significant amount of spare
worldwide production capacity, in excess of 10 mln bpd.""
     He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued
volatility and called for ""governmental and regulatory policies
in support of the domestic petroleum industry.""
     Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal
government through the 1986 tax code changes and ""Superfund""
legislation, Simon called for the repeal of the windfall
profits tax, total decontrol of natural gas and improved access
to federal lands for oil and gas exploration.
     Simon did not mention an oil import fee, which many in the
industry have called for as a way of building up the nation's
domestic operations before imports reach such a level that
national security might be compromised.
     In yesterday's report, the Energy Department said imports
could make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995, adding that
Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the
free world's total oil consumption by that date.
     Arguing that ""oil is a political tool in every nation on
earth,"" Frank Pitts, chairman of &lt;Pitts Oil Co&gt;, today called
for a variable oil import fee, among other measures, ""before
the treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and
our national security is compromised.""
     Royce Wisenbaker, Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co,
agreed, saying that like many federal government programs that
were set up with good intentions, it would probably turn into a
""shambles.""
     Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future.
""For those of us who have managed to hold on, the worst is
over,"" he said.
     Roger Hemminghaus, President of Diamond Shamrock Refining
and Marketing Co, said he was ""enthusiastic about the future,""
adding that he expected ""an increase in profitability by
midyear.""

<title>NE ELECTRIC SEES HIGHER CONSTRUCTION OUTLAYS</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </dateline>New England Electric System &lt;NES&gt;
expects its cash construction spending to reach 205 mln dlrs
this year, up from 188 mln dlrs in 1986, the utility said in
material distributed at an analysts meeting.
    It said spending is expected to advance to 215 mln dlrs in
1988 and 220 mln dlrs in 1989.
    The utility said these totals exclude spending on New
England Hydro-Transmission being built to import electricity
from Quebec Hydro. New England Electric is the operator of this
venture as well as owning 51 pct of the project.
    The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year, 105 mln
dlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmission
lines from northern Quebec into New England, the utility said.
    New England Electric said internally generated funds will
cover all of its power plant construction costs this year and
65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units plan
to spend in 1987.
    The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs on
its oil and gas activities this year, adding internally
generated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total.
    New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrs
worth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additional
higher cost preferred stock. Its Granite State Electric unit
plans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year
as well.
    The company said it does not plan to offer common shares
this year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raise
about 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its
dividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans.
    President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the
construction spending projection is based on the expectation
that demand for electricity in the New England electric system
will grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years.
    However, the utility cannot ignore the potential for
sharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2
pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years.
    He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices
and a strong New England economy.
    Huntington said New England Elecetric has ""all but rejected
new coal fired plants"" to supply additional power.
    He said the most attractive new power supplies are those
with short lead times which can be built in modules.
    Later, vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is
looking at gas-fired, combined cycle generating units to supply
most of its new power needs, but has not rejected coal-fired
fluidized bed units.
    He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in
modular units, adding that Huntington was referring to the
traditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal.

<title>DOE SECRETARY PROPOSES OIL TAX INCENTIVES</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </dateline>Energy Secretary John Herrington
said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil
and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan
Administration for consideration.
    ""These options boost production, while avoiding the huge
costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee,""
Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. ""It is my
intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy
council and the cabinet for consideration and review.""
    ""The goal of the Administration policies is to increase
domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels
a day,"" he said.
    The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday
warning the United States was threatened by a growing
dependence on oil imports.
    ""We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65
pct by 1995,"" Herrington said.

<title>MEXICAN HYDROCARBON RESERVES FALL SLIGHTLY IN 1986</title>
<dateline>    Mexico city, march 18 - </dateline>mexico's proven reserves of liquid
hydrocarbons at end-1986 were 70 billion barrels, slightly down
from 70.9 billion a year ago and 71.75 billion in 1984, the
state oil company petroleos mexicanos (pemex) announced.
    Reserves were just 5.77 billion barrels in 1974, rose
sharply to 40.19 billion in 1978 and flattened out at 72
billion in both 1981 and 1982.
    In its annual report, pemex said average crude output in
1986 was 2.43 mln barrels per day, 202,000 bpd down on 1985.
Average exports were 1.29 mln bpd, down from 1.44 mln bpd.
    The company did not say what percentage of hydrocarbons was
crude oil, but has previouly said it was about 48 pct.
    Natural gas output in 1986 was 3.43 billion cubic feet per
day, down from 3.6 billion in 1985.
    Due mainly to the fall in oil prices to around 12 dlrs from
25 dlrs in the year, 58 wells, both exploratory and production,
were suspended, 38 of them in less productive areas than the
offshore campeche fields which accounted for 64 pct of
production.

<title>NO IMMEDIATE PLANS TO CLOSE REFINERY - ESSO SAF</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, March 18 - </dateline>ESSO SAF &lt;ESSF.PA&gt;, the French subsidiary
of Exxon Corp &lt;XON&gt;, said it had no immediate plans to shut
down one of its two refineries. Exxon's new president Lee R.
Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a French
refinery.
    An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis that
depended on the evolution of the market and refineries' ability
to make money. He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur
Mer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment
over 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses.
    The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity
of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer's is five mln, the
spokesman added.
    Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would
be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the Port
Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a
petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant.
    Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview that
Exxon was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might
decide to close one of its French refineries.

<title>DIVISION SEEN ON HOW TO HELP U.S. OIL INDUSTRY</title>
<author>    By TED d'AFFLISIO, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </dateline>The U.S. Congress and the oil industry
are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the
industry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and the
subsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said.
    ""The industry is deeply divided between those who support an
oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,""
said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S.
Congress on energy issues.
    Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax
incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee.
    Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will
propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural
gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for
consideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
proposal would be reviewed.
    Herrington said, ""I would like to shoot for one mln barrels
a day (addition) to U.S. production."" U.S. oil output was off to
8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from last
year, the American Petroleum Institute said.
    Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average
about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a
move above that level will be unlikey for the near term.
    Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that
""even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we've
only altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for
the year.""
    Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and
exploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output
will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable
prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration.
    John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to
Congress said ""The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is
virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. But
the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil
prices and U.S. government policy.""
    Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil
production but would only work over time.
    ""Lowering the producing industry's tax burden would probably
be a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase but
would not raise energy costs."" Lichtblau said.
    But the small independent oil companies who do much of the
drilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief
which could be brought on by an oil import fee.
    Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the International
Association of Drilling Contractors, said, ""The members of our
trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil
import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our
nation."" The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil
service companies.
    The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee
will face a stiff uphill battle.
    Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by
a former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oil
import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a
means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry.
     At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed
opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would
hurt consumers and some regional interests.
    But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow
if production continued to fall and imports to rise.
    Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements
""is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move above
that level, a fee may not be legislated but there will
certainly be pressure for some form of action.""
     But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, ""a 50 pct
rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990.
    In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energy
requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added.

<title>RECENT U.S. OIL DEMAND UP 2.3 PCT FROM YEAR AGO</title>

<title>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY</title>
<author>    By Stephen Jukes, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    RIYADH, March 19 - </dateline>Higher world oil prices, coupled with a
new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia's
economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget
deficits, bankers and diplomats said.
    The months ahead will prove critical as the government
attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices
and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private
sector.
    Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to
about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could
grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982.
    But the economists said this will be possible only if the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds
in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced
to curtail output for too long.
    Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend
OPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price.
    Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at
about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi
Arabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987.
    King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's
new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western
diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a
stable source of income for its economy.
    Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is a
hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining
revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross
domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985.
    Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10
dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion
dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981.
    ""Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not
be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can
afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst
effects,"" a diplomat said.
    In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of
lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on
foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs.
    But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers
and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in
the longer term.
    It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a
time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise
to take over the lead role in the economy.
    Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of
the risks attached to this policy but is determined to ""tough it
out"" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion
of reserves.
    The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion
riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly
recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign
borrowing has been ruled out.
    Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi
businessmen this week the government had carefully considered
the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget
plans late last year.
    ""It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50
billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the
economy,"" he said.
    Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early
1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and
tales of high spending became legendary.
    The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the
fabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management
had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom.
    Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced,
markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut
back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply.
    The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but
Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate
sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit.
    Government moves to encourage lending and investigate
company complaints about late public sector contract payments
could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's
industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment.
    Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and
more cash being placed on deposit.
    As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic
development from the public to the private sector, one of the
biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel
personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom
and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.

<title>U.S. ENERGY CHIEF SEES PROMISE IN OIL-TAX CHANGE</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 19 - </dateline>Energy Secretary John Herrington
said his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance
to 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way to
spur domestic production.
    The White House has said it would consider the option
although it was generally opposed to any revisions in the new
tax code.
    Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas
Association that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and
enhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a

    The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and
the national security the Energy Department sent to the White

option: ""that is one that could significantly increase

<title>BRITOIL SEES LOWER U.K. EXPLORATION EXPENDITURE</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 19 - </dateline>Britoil Plc's &lt;BTOL.L&gt; exploration
expenditure for the U.K. In 1987 was likely to be only about a
third of the level in 1986, though overseas expenditure would
remain approximately the same, Chief executive David Walker
said.
    He told reporters following the release of the company's
1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986
levels.
    U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from
184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from
156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in
1985.
    Earlier, Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to
134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985, before an extraordinary
charge of 50 mln stg on the company's U.S. Assets. The results
were slightly better than analysts forecast and the share
firmed to 231p from 222p at last night's close. Chairman Sir
Philip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986
had made the period extremely difficult but the company had
come through remarkably well.
    Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, the
conditions would be right for a substantially improved
performance this year.
    He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, when
they were normally weaker, made him ""a bit encouraged"" about the
prospects for future levels.
    Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price
stayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel.
    Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement
of a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the
latter part of April.
    End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared
with 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that this
included a revised definition of reserves.
    If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, the
reserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels
previously.
    Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from a
restated 3,660 billion.

<title>API SAYS U.S. CRUDE OIL OUPUT OFF FROM YEAR AGO</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 19 - </dateline>The American Petroleum Institute
said that U.S. crude oil production in February declined 9.8
pct from year-ago levels to about 8.3 mln barrels a day.
    In its monthly report on U.S. oil supplies and stocks, API
said that domestic demand for petroleum products, as measured
by products supplied, continued to rise reaching 16.3 mln
barrels a day in the month, up 1.5 pct from February 1986.
    API noted the drop in crude oil output coupled with a
drop in natural gas liquids production, which was off 11 pct
from February 1986 levels, represented a decline in U.S.
production of more than one mln barrels a day.
    API said the decline in domestic production and the rise in
demand brought petroleum imports to about six mln barrels a day
in February, a 30.3 pct increase from last year's level.
    So far this year, API said growth in domestic demand, which
was up 2.9 pct from last year's year-to-date level, has slowed
in comparison to the accelerated growth in the last half of
1986.
    It said crude oil production for the first two months of
1987 was off 8.6 pct from the comparable year-ago period while
crude imports were up 30.6 pct.

<title>UK CROSS FIELD PRT RELIEF FAVOURS SMALLER FIELDS</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 19 - </dateline>The ""cross field allowance"" relief on
Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT
paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co.
    The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of
qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of
other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments
outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.
    A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not
paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly
benefit in PRT saving on an existing field.
    ""The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators
in those fields which have no PRT liability,"" the report said,
adding that the timing of development of such fields may be
advanced.
    The government would in effect be subsidising these
developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before
corporation tax, the report said.
    On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is
of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will
be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will
rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.
    In a study on probable fields, the report said that when
the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying
field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the
U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a
small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9
pct.
    The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will
be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only
will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's
future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will
be lost.
    Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts
will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later
time.

<title>AMOCO &lt;AN&gt; OIL RESERVES DOWN, GAS UP IN 1986</title>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, March 19 - </dateline>Amoco Corp's petroleum liquids reserves
total 2.42 billion barrels at the end of 1986, down from 2.77
billion a year earlier, but its natural gas reserves increased
to 15.37 trillion cubic feet from 15.14 trillion, the company's
annual report said.
    It said the drop in crude oil and natural gas liquid
reserves reflected downward revisions of previous estimates
caused by the sharp drop in oil prices last year. This
accounted for 178 mln barrels of a worldwide downward revision
of 188 mln barrels, with 158 mln barrels of the total revision
occurring in the United States, the report said.
    Amoco said there were upward revisions in the size of its
worldwide gas reserves totalling 404 billion cubic feet last
year, while it discovered 568 billion cubic feet and purchased
298 billion cubic feet of reserves.
    Production of one trillion cubic feet offset much of these
gains, the report said.
    All of the gas reserve purchases, as well as all of the 14
mln barrels of oil reserves bought in 1986, were in the United
States, Amoco said, noting it has spent 1.1 billion dlrs to
acquire U.S. producing properties over the past three years.
    Commenting on 1987, Amoco said acquisitions ""will be an
integral part of our strategy, should reserves become available
at attractive prices.""
    The company said it expects ""the marketing climate for
natural gas to improve in 1987, which should provide the
opportunity for Amoco to expand sales. As prices and demand
improve, we are poised to accelerate capital spending on our
inventory of attractive opportunities.""
    Amoco previously announced a 1987 capital spending budget
of 3.2 billion dlrs. Such spending totaled 3.18 billion dlrs
last year, down from 5.31 billion in 1985.

<title>NATURAL GAS SEEN RECAPTURING SOME MARKET SHARE</title>
<author>    By NAILENE CHOU-WIEST, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </dateline>Higher crude oil prices will raise
demand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lost
to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said.
    The analysts said that these efforts will be most
successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large
and growing energy requirements.
    ""Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of
oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual
fuel industry last year,"" Michael Smolinski, an energy
economist with Data Resources Inc, told Reuters.
    An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel went
into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last
year when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said. 
    Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, national
average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected
2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive,
Michael German, vice president of economic analysis at American
Gas Association said.
    The average delivered prices at the end of January were
2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago.
    ""We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic
feet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second and
third quarter (1987),"" he said.
    In addition to price competitiveness, availability will be
an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas,
Frank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp.
in New York noted.
    Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North
American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and
less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this
spring freeing gas for spot sales.
    These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears
that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices
significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last
year.
    AGA's German contended that despite the drilling decline,
much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to production
quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which
permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins.
    Citing recent EIA statistics, German said, the gas surplus
was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986
to two trillion cubic feet in 1987, but the surplus would not
go away until 1990.
    Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would
persist until 1990. While gas supplies may tighten in certain
consuming areas, notably in California and in the Northeast
U.S., an overall shortfall appeared remote.

<title>WORLD BANK LIKELY TO URGE CHANGES ON JAKARTA</title>
<author>    By Jeremy Clift, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, March 22 - </dateline>World Bank President Barber Conable is
expected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest
debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to
tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said.
    Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will
meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers.
    He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia's
largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world
oil prices called for major policy adjustments.
    Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects
in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populous
island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed
discussions with ministers tomorrow.
    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely
hit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and
gas revenues in half.
    Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to
provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia
pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects.
    Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to
the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31
pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to
bridge its deficit.
    Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto
and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy
change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost
protected economy.
    ""Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call
for major policy adjustments and external support,"" Conable said
in his arrival statement.
    But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next
month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that
the Bank is demanding specific changes.
    ""We believe there has been wise leadership here and the
economy is being very well managed,"" Conable told reporters at
Jakarta airport.
    Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling
37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the
Third World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7
billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968.
    Conable did not spell out what further changes he would
like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes
already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more.
    Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support,
the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the
government's trade reform measures, and supported its
determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth.
    Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last
May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage
outside investment.
    Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look
into which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be
sold.
    But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the
government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms.
    Western analysts say that in particular the government is
unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost
monopolies, which control core areas of the economy.
    Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that
Indonesia faced very limited economic choices.
    It could not spend its way out of trouble because this
would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic
inflation.
     He said the main objective was to raise exports outside
the oil and natural gas sector.
    Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the
government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial
year which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in
1986/87.

<title>AUSTRALIA SAID TO RELY TOO MUCH ON OIL TAXES</title>
<dateline>    SURFERS PARADISE, Australia, March 23 - </dateline>The government's
over-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting
Australia's economic performance, Australian Petroleum
Exploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said.
    Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income is
derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak
crude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here.
    This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the
country's economic performance directly by acting as a
disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting
trading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said.
    Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency
position is posing a major economic threat, yet the
government's response has been to load new tax burdens on the
oil industry, Benbow said.
    Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to
fall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from
546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of the
Bass Strait fields, he said.
    Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with the
three largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said.
    By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just over
half the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undeveloped
fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from
existing fields goes ahead, Benbow said.
    Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered
fields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said.
    Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to
680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying a
crude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years
time, he said.
    At present world oil prices and the current value of the
Australian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost
between 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said.
    Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, the
addition to reserves has been inadequate, he said.
    For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five
years 1980-84 represent about two years' consumption, he said.
    He called on the government to review its tax policies to
restore incentive to exploration.

<title>EXXON OFFICIAL URGES PLANNING FOR NEXT OIL SURGE</title>
<dateline>    SURFERS PARADISE, Australia, March 23 - </dateline>World governments
should prepare for an inevitable significant increase in the
price of oil as non-Middle East supplies diminish, Exxon Corp
&lt;XON&gt; director and senior vice-president Donald McIvor said.
    Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk
of world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in a
speech prepared for delivery to the Australian Petroleum
Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference.
    It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere
will not change this fact, he said.
    McIvor said 37 of the world's 30,000 oil fields contain
about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered.
    Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the
Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the
last 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said.
    He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming
20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the
rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year.
    More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the
Middle East, he said.
    McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil
outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a
diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic
stability.
    ""It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country
discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable
taxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up of
acreage for exploration,"" he said.
    Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost the
incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of
petroleum, he added.

<title>AUSTRALIAN OIL TAX CUT SEEN BOOSTING OUTPUT</title>
<dateline>    SURFERS PARADISE, Australia, March 23 - </dateline>A 10 percentage
point reduction in the Australian government's maximum crude
oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output,
resources analyst Ian Story said here.
    A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait
output to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels
per day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000
BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration
Association annual conference.
    Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney
stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd.
    Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer
appropriate in the current economic climate, Story said.
    The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered
before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co
Ltd &lt;BRKN.S&gt;/Exxon Corp &lt;XON&gt; partnership to shut-in
production, accelerating the decline in output and reducing
government revenue, he said.
    He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30
Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs
if the levy was cut to 70 pct.
    ""The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive
at oil prices below 30 dlrs,"" Story said.
    Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher
levels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boost
exports and provide incentives for exploration and development,
he said.

<title>BP GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY SHUT, HYDROCRACKER DAMAGED</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, MARCH 23 - </dateline>The entire British Petroleum Co PLC
refinery at Grangemouth in Scotland has been shut down
following the explosion and fire that severely damaged the
hydrocracker at the site, a refinery spokesman said.
    He said the rest of the 178,500 bpd refinery, including the
19,000 bpd catalytic cracker, was undamaged. The whole refinery
was closed pending enquiries but a decision when to reopen the
main units will be taken in the next couple of days, he said.
    But there was extensive damage to the central part of the
32,000 bpd hydrocracker, which upgrades heavy oil products to
gasoline, and it will be out of operation for some months.
    The spokesman said BP will not suffer supply shortages as a
result of the explosion as it will be able to bring in product
from other sources. BP has a 437,000 bpd refinery in Rotterdam,
a 181,900 bpd unit at Ingolstadt, West Germany, a 181,900 bpd
plant at Lavera in France and a smaller Swedish plant.
    He said the explosion and fire, in which one worker was
killed, occurred when the hydrocracker was not in operation.
    The refinery as a whole had been operating at about half of
its capacity since the end of January while an extensive
overhaul was carried out on the North Side of the complex where
the hydrocracker is sited, he said.
    This work was scheduled to be completed by mid-April, but
this is now being assessed following the hydrocracker accident.
    Two people were killed in an explosion and fire in a flare
line at the Grangemouth refinery on March 13, but the spokesman
said this incident was some 100 yards from the latest accident.

<title>IRAN SAYS IT INTENDS NO THREAT TO GULF SHIPPING</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 23 - </dateline>Iran said reports that it intended to
threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless, and warned the
U.S. And other countries not to interfere in the region.
    Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign
Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would
be met by ""a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the
world.""
     U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks
apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do
whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face
of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf.
    The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been
told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a
threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf.
    U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made
anti-ship ""Silkworm"" missiles, which pose a greater threat to
merchant ships than missiles used before.
    The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended
to attack ships were ""misleading propaganda.""
    He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause
of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use ""all
its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension.""
    Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. ""We
are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping
going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very
vital waterway.""
    ""We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of what
might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and
listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in
keeping navigation free in that area,"" he said.
    Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area were
not unusual.
    A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty
Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea.
    The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as saying
the U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in the
region.

<title>WORLD DEPENDENCY ON MIDEAST OIL SAID INEVITABLE</title>
<author>    By TED d'AFFLISIO, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 23 - </dateline>The world's dependency on the Mideast
as the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going
to stop it, Donald K. McIvor, an Exxon Corp &lt;XON&gt; Director and
senior vice president told Reuters in an interview.
    ""Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap
between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to
increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is
inevitable,"" McIvor said.
    Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are
not likely to change a growing dependence, McIvor said.
    McIvor, Exxon's senior vice president responsible for oil
and gas exploration and production said that dependence would
result from the Mideast's large spare capacity at a time when
the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding.
    ""Since 1970 we've been consuming oil at rates of 20-25
billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only
about 10-15 bilion barrels per year,"" McIvor said.
    ""The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the
remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is
producing at much less than current capacity,"" he added.
    McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discovered
so far only 37 ""one-one thousandth of the total number contained
about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered.""
    McIvor said, in response to a question, that he did not
believe there were any more ""super giants"", or oil fields with
reserves greater than five billion barrels, to be found which
would change the conclusion of the world's growing dependency.
    ""Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle
East. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20
years and only two of these lie outside the middle east
(Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska's North Slope)."" McIvor said.
    McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S.
like Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a
peak and would soon begin to decline.
    But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty
of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the
Middle east, particulartly in Canada, the North Sea, and
Australia and Africa.
    McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those
areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher
price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the
companies.
    ""The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a
constant change in policies,"" McIvor said.
    McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to
increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the
economy at the expense of other parts of the economy.
    Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. Energy
Secretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said he
could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance
now but ""the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It has
highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the
need to increase U.S. production.""
    McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a
greater role in the future in meeting energy needs.
    ""Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an
increasingly important part of the worlkd's energy supply,""
McIvor said.
    ""Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation
fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat, as an
industrial fuel,"" he added.

<title>U.S. PREPARED TO ESCORT KUWAITI TANKERS</title>
<author>    By CHARLES ALDINGER, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 23 - </dateline>The United States has offered Navy
warships to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers into and out of the 
Gulf where they could be threatened by new Iranian anti-ship
missiles, U.S. defense officials said today.
    ""We believe the Kuwaitis have also approached the Soviet
Union about the possibility of using Soviet tankers"" to ship
their oil, one of the officials told Reuters. ""But if there is
superpower protection, we would rather it come from us,"" the
official said.
    The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Kuwait
had asked about possible protection for a dozen vessels, most
of them oil tankers, which could be supplied by three U.S. Navy
guided missile destroyers and two guided missile frigates now
in the southern part of the Gulf.
    ""We told them we would give them help and we are waiting to
hear the Kuwaiti response to our offer,"" one official said.
    In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy's small
Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has
moved 18 warships -- including the Aircraft Carrier Kitty Hawk
-- into the northern Indian Ocean in the past month.
    White House and defense officials said today that massing
of the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the
Iran-Iraq war or Iran's recent stationing of Chinese-made 
anti-ship missiles near the mouth of the Gulf.
    The land-based missiles have increased concern in Kuwait
and other Middle East countries that their oil shipments might
be affected. Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in
the  Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984. White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters today that it was in
the U.S. strategic interest to keep the free flow of oil in the
gulf and through the Straits of Hormuz.
    But he said U.S. ships in the region were on routine
maneuvers.
    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on Sunday declined to
discuss specifics, but said the United States would do whatever
was necessary to keep the Gulf shipping open in the face of new
Iranian anti-ship missiles in the region.
    ""We are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the
shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in
that very vital waterway of the world,"" he said on NBC
television's ""Meet the Press.""
    The State Department said Friday Iran has been informed
about U.S. concern over the threat to oil shipments in the
Gulf. The communciation was sent through Switzerland, which
represents American interests in Iran.
     Iran on Sunday denied as baseless reports that it intended
to threaten shipping in the gulf and warned the United States
that any interference in the region would meet a strong
response from Tehran, Tehran Radio said.
    An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted in a
broadcast monitored by the BBC in London, said reports that
Iran intends to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless.
    ""In conjunction with this misleading propaganda, America has
already paved the ground to achieve its expansionist and

<title>IRAQ REPORTS ATTACKS ON SUPERTANKER, OIL TARGETS</title>
<author>    By MAAMOUN YOUSSEF, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    BAGHDAD, March 23 - </dateline>Iraq said today its warplnes had
attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to
keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends.
    The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations
broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action.
    It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad
hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian
year which ended on Saturday.
    A high command communique said warplanes hit the western
jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and
struck a supertanker nearby at the same time.
    The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August
1985, was last raided in January.
    The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said
columns of smoke were seen billowing from it.
    In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian
tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier
Gulf attack.
    But there has been no independent confirmation of today's
supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by
Baghdad in the past 24 hours.
    The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight,
when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg.
    Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at
Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50
miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said.
    The three oilfields have been raided several times in the
past three years. Oil sources said they were not crucially
important to Iran's oil export trade.
    A second high command communique today said Iraqi warplanes
flew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the war
front.
    It also reported a clash between Iraqi naval units and
several Iranian boats carrying men to attack an Iraqi oil
terminal at the northen tip of the Gulf.
    Two Iranian boats wer destroyed and sunk with their
occupants and the others fled, it said.

<title>ENERGY ANALYST PROPOSES U.S. OIL TARIFF</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 23 - </dateline>Energy analyst Edward Krapels said
the United States should consider an oil tariff to keep U.S.
dependence on imports below 50 pct.
    ""On the supply side, the argument in favor of a contingent,
variable import tariff is most persuasive,"" Krapels, president
of Energy Security Analysis, Inc said in a statement at a House
Energy and Power subcommittee hearing.
    ""An optimal tariff would be one implemented only if the
international price of crude oil falls below, say, 15 dlrs a
barrel. On the demand side, the obvious policy is an excise tax
on transportation fuels,"" Krapels said.
    But William Johnson of the Jofree Corp disagreed with the
oil tariff proposal, saying Congress should remove price
controls on natural gas, repeal the windfall profits tax on oil
companies, allow exports of Alaskan oil and provide tax
incentives for U.S. oil production, or, at the least, preserve
exisiting tax incentives for drilling. He also urging filling
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate.
    Richard Adkerson of Arthur Andersen and Co told the

funds for exploration and development of domestic oil sources

<title>AUSTRALIAN MINISTER SEES TARGETED OIL TAX STRATEGY</title>
<dateline>    SURFERS PARADISE, Australia, March 24 - </dateline>Australia's crude
oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a
targeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resources
and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here.
    He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association
(APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a
package that would recognise the government's economic
priorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns.
    Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review
of oil taxation.
    Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted
approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results
in recent years.
    These include the reduction in the top marginal crude
excise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September
1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshore
oil announced last September, he said.
    The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for the
elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost
incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices
and Australia's relatively low exploration levels.
    ""While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to
an already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favour
these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes,
which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may still
leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are
going to do in major areas,"" Evans said.
    He said the government did not intend to change its
resource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now before
parliament, in response to industry calls to allow all
exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible.
    As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to
highly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after a
certain rate of return has been achieved for individual
projects.
    APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because
exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects.
    Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more
than anything on the government's desire to ensure the
certainty and stability of the new regime, adding that major
investments have already been planned on the existing ground
rules.

<title>WORLD BANK CHIEF PLEDGES SUPPORT TO INDONESIA</title>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, March 24 - </dateline>World Bank president Barber Conable
pledged the Bank's support to help Indonesia adjust to lower
world oil prices, but said further deregulation of its
protected economy was needed.
    Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto,
he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the
economy and deregulate trade policy.
    Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which
cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third
World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs
from the World Bank in the past 20 years.
    Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300
mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was
prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to
lower oil and primary commodity prices.
    ""We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are
consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy,"" he
said.
    He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last
year's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the
difficulties now faced by other countries.
    Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the
dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and
has announced a series of measures since May intended to
stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise
the economy.
    However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics
and high tariff barriers remain in place.
    Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met
14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country's
borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the

<title>AUSTRALIAN OIL INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TAX CAMPAIGN</title>
<dateline>    SURFERS PARADISE, Australia, March 24 - </dateline>The council of the
Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said it
will press on with its campaign for major improvements to
Australia's petroleum taxation structure.
    The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly
disappointed by the Australian government's position on
taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy
Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference.
    As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target
any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to
secondary taxation of petroleum.
    APEA had expected the government to make positive responses
to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of
existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and
development, the council said.
    It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by
Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed
with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation.
    Evans told the conference the government did not plan to
accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow
deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.
    ""The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction of
unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore
area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is
profit based,"" the APEA council said.
    The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil
exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the
industry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry's
problems, the council said.
    The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory
secondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major
disincentives at a time of low oil prices.

    Reagan administration officials said later that Washington
did not seek military confrontation with Tehran, but would not

of covering the narrow entrance to the Gulf, to choke oil

    Defence officials said Kuwait had asked if protection for

southern Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.
    In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy's small

Dutch/Shell Group's &lt;RD.AS&gt; Norwegian subsidiary, said it has
nearly concluded a 10 billion crown development scheme for
Norway's Draugen oil field and will declare the field
commercial in the near future.
    Pending government approval of the scheme, the field could
come on stream in 1992, making it Norway's northermost field
development and the first such project on the Haltenbanken
tract off central Norway.
    Work on the project could begin as early as January 1988, a
Shell spokesman said.
    Shell has not released projected output levels for the
field, where water depth is 240-270 meters.
    The spokesman said the field's partners have agreed to
develop Draugen with a 300-meter, single-leg concrete
gravity-base platform.
    The scheme also proposes using remote subsea production
wells to tap the field's reservoir, estimated to contain 375
mln barrels of oil, and an offshore buoy-loading system to
transport oil from the field by ship.
    Partners on Draugen are Shell, the operator, with a 30 pct
stake, British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L&gt; unit &lt;BP Petroleum
Development (Norway) Ltd&gt; (20 pct) and state-owned Den Norske
Stats Oljeselskap A/S &lt;STAT.OL&gt; (Statoil) (50 pct).

<title>U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY OPTIMISTIC ON INCENTIVES</title>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, March 24 - </dateline>U.S. Department of Energy Secretary
John Herrington said he was ""optimistic"" about the chances of
providing a more generous depletion allowance for oil and gas
producers, but added that the plan faces strong opposition from
some members of the Reagan administration.
    Herrington, speaking to Houston oil executives at a
breakfast meeting, said administration debate over his plan for
a 27.5 pct annual depletion allowance was ""heavy and strong""
largely because of some fears that the U.S. oil industry could
eventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as the
agriculture industry.
    Herrington's proposed tax incentives for the oil industry
were issued last week after the Department of Energy released a
comprehensive report finding U.S. national security could be
jeopardized by rising oil imports.
    In response to a question from Mitchell Energy and
Development Corp &lt;MND&gt; chairman, George Mitchell, Herrington
said the report did not definitively rule out an oil import
tarrif. ""We intend to keep that debate open,"" Herrington said.
    However, following his speech, Herrington told Reuters that
the new report shows an oil import fee ""is not economical.""
    Herrington said, for example, a 10 dlr per barrel tariff on
oil imports would cause the nation's gross national product to
drop by as much as 32 billion dlrs.
    Herrington also said he believed President Reagan, who
requested the comprehensive national security study, was
committed to some action to help the ailing U.S. oil industry.
    ""I'm quite confident he understands the problems and is
prepared to do something about it,"" Herrington said.

******<title>U.S. SUPREME COURT ALLOWS OFFSHORE ALASKAN OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION
</title>Blah blah blah.


</text>",crude,4
"<text>
<title>U.S. COURT ALLOWS OFFSHORE ALASKAN EXPLORATION</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </dateline>A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that
oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the
Alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to
eight major oil companies.
    The ruling was an important victory for the oil companies
and the Reagan administration's controversial off-shore leasing
program and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that
challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment.
    The administration said that the court-ordered halt in
drilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paid
for 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980.
    A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt
all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in
the Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to the
subsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos.
    But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong in
issuing an injunction halting exploration.
    ""Here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration was
not at all probable,"" Justice Byron White wrote for the court.
""And on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact
that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs
to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which
they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration
been enjoined,"" he said.
    The oil companies, Amoco Corp &lt;AN&gt;, ARCO, Exxon Corp &lt;XON&gt;,
Mobil Corp &lt;MOB&gt;, Sohio, Shell, Texaco Inc &lt;TX&gt; and Union Oil,
had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in
staggering financial losses.
    The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres and
generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984
covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs.
    Administration officials, saying the lease sales were
preceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied that
the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources.
    The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins, along with an
organization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta, argued that
the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing.

<title>OIL TAX BREAK RIDICULED BY U.S. HOUSE TAXWRITER</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </dateline>A House taxwriter said Energy
Secretary James Herrington's ""outrageous"" plan to restore an old
tax break for oil companies was both bad tax and energy policy.
    Rep. Pete Stark, a California Democrat and senior House
Ways and Means Committee member, said Herrington's plan for a
27.5 pct depletion allowance--which in effect is a special 27.5
pct tax deduction --would cost seven billion dlrs a year.
    ""He must have missed the last two years of federal tax
reform by sleeping as soundly as Rip Van Winkle,"" Stark said.

<title>DRAWDOWN SEEN IN U.S. DISTILLATE STOCKS</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 24 - </dateline>Tonight's American Petroleum Institute
oil inventory report is expected to show another drawdown in
distillate stocks of between two and 7.5 mln barrels for the
week ending March 20, oil analysts and traders said.
    They said they expect gasoline inventories to be depleted
by about one to four mln barrels.
    Analysts were divided on the crude stocks. Some saw stocks
unchanged to as much as three mln barrels higher. Others said
stocks could be down one to five mln barrels. Crude throughput
volumes are expected to be unchanged to slightly higher or
lower than the week ended March 13, traders said.
    The API recorded a 7.4 mln barrel stockdraw for U.S.
distillates in the week ended March 13. Analysts see another 
draw reflecting historic seasonal trends.
    For the week ended March 13, API reported gasoline stocks
down 2.9 mln barrels.
    Those expecting a draw of as much as four mln barrels said
they are looking for fairly high consumption rates as the
spring and summer driving season gets underway this year,
because retail prices are still low compared to recent years.
    U.S. crude oil stocks were reported down by 4.4 mln barrels
for the week ended March 13. Analysts are divided over the
outcome for last week because there is uncertainty about
whether throughput levels increased or decreased last week.
    Some see crude stock levels unchanged to three mln barrels
higher, while others think inventories could be as much as five
mln barrels below the previous week.
    The lower estimates are supported by the belief that crude
runs increased and imports fell.
    The API reported crude runs 154,000 b/d higher for the week
ended March 13. Analysts are calling it unchanged to slightly
up or down for the week ended March 20.
    Expectations for product stockdraws are already being
reflected in firmer prices, traders said. But if draws are at
the higher end of the estimated range, they added, the effect
will be bullish. Any stockbuild would be a negative factor,
they said.
    Crude runs normally increase in March, and any decrease in
runs would be friendly to the market, said Peter Beutel of
Elders Energy Futures Inc.

<title>MADAGASCAR EXTENDS AMOCO OIL EXPLORATION AGREEMENT</title>
<dateline>    ANTANANARIVO, March 25 - </dateline>Madagascar extended its oil
exploration agreement with the U.S. Firm Amoco Corp &lt;AN&gt; for 17
months to allow for further studies of the Morondava basin on
the southwest coast, a government statement said.
    It said the existing five-year agreement, due to expire
this July 24, was extended until the end of 1988 to allow for
additional geological and geophysical studies.
    Amoco has so far laid 7,100 km of seismic lines and sunk
five exploration wells in the Morondava basin. It may drill a
further three wells before the end of the extended exploration
period, the statement said.
    Madagascar has signed oil exploration agreements with four

<title>ABU DHABI TO REOPEN GULF OILFIELD HIT IN 1986 RAID</title>
<dateline>    ABU DHABI, March 25 - </dateline>Abu Dhabi's offshore Abu al-Bukhoosh
oilfield in the Gulf, shut since an aerial attack last
November, will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences are
ready, and this could be in the next two months, oil industry
sources said.
    They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise
des Petroles (Total) &lt;TPN.PA&gt;, whose Total Abu al-Bukhoosh
subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on the
reopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed.
    Unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off Abu Dhabi,
last November 25.
    The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living
quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production
platform.
    Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible
but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq.
    Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd)
at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resume
at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and
the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable.
    The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in
remaining accomodations, the sources said.
    Facilities being installed to protect the field include
aircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housing
for military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sources
said.
    Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab
Emirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15
mln bpd production, the sources said.
    They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field,
part of the same reservoir as Abu al-Bukhoosh and located only
a few miles away. Sassan was heavily damaged by an Iraqi air
raid only 10 days before Abu al-Bukhoosh was attacked.

<title>OIL ANALYST SEES PAPUA NEW GUINEA AS GOOD PROSPECT</title>
<dateline>    SURFERS PARADISE, Australia, March 25 - </dateline>Papua New Guinea
(PNG) provides the most exciting new prospect in the
Asia-Pacific region for oil production, energy analyst Fereidun
Fesharaki said here.
    The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNG
on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he told
the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual
conference.
    Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East-West
Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia-Pacific
petroleum outlook.
    With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd)
and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991,
PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter, Fesharaki
said.
    The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the best
oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG.
    The PNG government's Geological Survey in a paper
distributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves at
about 500 mln barrels.
    PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with
no secondary taxes, Fesharaki said.
    ""We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, and
discovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to
(light) Bass Strait crude,"" Fesharaki said.
    There are also large pockets of high quality condensates to
be produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which is
capable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said.
    But prices should be somewhat higher than the present
levels to justify development of the Juha field, he said.
    The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five large
prospective but little-explored sedimentary basins in PNG.

to foreign and domestic applicants in the first phase of the
country's eleventh concession round, government officials said.
    Company shares in each of the licences proposed by the Oil

companies 10 days to accept or decline the proposed shares.
    French companies Ste Nationale Elf Aquitaine &lt;ELFP.PA&gt; and
Total Cie Francaise des Petroles &lt;TPN.PA&gt;, which were expected
to receive operatorships following France's agreement last
autumn to purchase gas from Norway's Troll field, were not
offered operatorships in this round, industry sources said.
    Three eleventh round blocks were awarded in the
Haltenbanken exploration tract off central Norway, including
the Smoerbukk West field where Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S

    Statoil will share the licence with subsidiaries of U.S.
Oil companies Tenneco Inc &lt;TGT.N&gt; and Texas Eastern Corp

the relatively unexplored Moere South exploration area south of
Haltenbanken, with A/S Norske Shell, Texas Eastern and
&lt;Petroleo Brasileiro SA&gt; (Petrobras) also offered stakes in the
block.
    Norwegian companies landed operatorships on all six blocks
opened in the Barents Sea area off northern Norway. The blocks
were awarded in three licenses, each covering two blocks.
    Statoil will head exploration on blocks 7224/7 and 7224/8,
sharing the licence with Exxon Corp's &lt;XON.N&gt; Norwegian

<dateline>    JEDDAH, March 25 - </dateline>British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
denied in an interview published in Saudi Arabia today that her
government's oil policy contributed to weakness in world oil

    Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall
in oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same as
in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel.
    British production was on a plateau and was unlikely to
increase in the future, she said.
    ""We naturally share the concern of Saudi Arabia and other

<title>ENERGY/U.S. OIL OUTPUT</title>
<author>    By ROBERT TRAUTMAN, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </dateline>Energy Secretary John Herrington has
proposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production, but he said
all would cost the Treasury money and will come under close
White House scrutiny before action is taken.
    One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion
allowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as
production using enhanced extraction methods.
    Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year.
The White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending the
tax code, but would look at the proposal.
    Herrington's proposals to spur production were made along
with the release last week of the energy department's report on
energy and the national security.
    The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit
50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging
implications for national security.
    He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that
any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production
would have to meet three criteria--increase production, not
cause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer.
    Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test,
spurring production but fail the second and third.
    He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil 
workers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oil
prices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwide
and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs.
    A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteria
by not increasing domestic production.
    In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remains
firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax.
    Options which meet Herrington's criteria include:
    - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by
borrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that if
oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that
could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs.
    - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It
would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000
barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year.
    - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical
expenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a
day, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs.
    - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to
spur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for
the typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower
the cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs.
    Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration
proposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut
the need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily.
    He also called again for Congressional approval to explore
off the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion
barrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which
may hold nine billion barrels.
    Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to 
amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these
proposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/security
study would make a strong case for the need to help the
struggling domestic oil industry.
    Another move Herrington said he will press anew, even
though it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is to
raise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to
100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000.
    This, he said, would further bolster national security in
case of an oil-supply disruption.

<title>CANADA SETS OIL INDUSTRY AID PACKAGE</title>
<dateline>    EDMONTON, Alberta, March 25 - </dateline>Canada's federal government
will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that
includes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of a
company's oil and gas exploration and development costs, Energy
Minister Marcel Masse announced.
    The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into
the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one
billion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference.
    The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada on
or after April 1, 1987.
    Masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aid
package is aimed at small and medium sized companies.
    The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration and
Development Incentive Program, will restrict the total payments
that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year.
    Masse said the program will probably generate new
employment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year.
    He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and
development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil
prices fell during the first half of 1986.
    Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided
to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying
companies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the full
value of the incentive. Such companies would not immediately
benefit from tax benefits, he said.
    The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid
program outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilson
is now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce tax
reform proposals later this spring.
    An important feature of the aid program is a decision to
let companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors to
benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to
only participating companies, he said.
    Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make it
easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and
development, Masse said.
    He told reporters his department is still considering
whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for
the subsidy.

seek protection of its assets and business pursuant to the
bankruptcy and reorganization provisions of Chapter 11"" of the
federal bankruptcy code.
    Commenting on a Texas Court of Appeals ruling which reduced
Pennzoil's judgement by two billion dlrs, to 9.1 billion dlrs,
Texaco said it will file a motion for a rehearing by the
appeals court no later than March 30.
    Texaco said the proven crude oil reserves of the company
and its consolidated subsidiaries totaled 2.54 billion barrels
at the end of 1986, down from 2.69 billion a year earlier.
    However, inclusion of Texaco's equity in the Eastern
Hemisphere reserves of a nonsubsidiary company limited the
decline to 2.91 billion barrels from 3.00 billion at the end of
1985.
    Worldwide production by the consolidated subsidiaries
declined to 341 mln barrels last year from 362 mln in 1985 and
upward revisions in previous reserve estimates rose to 143 mln
barrels from 117 mln, respectively.
    Texaco said the largest drop in reserves came in the United
States -- where the total dropped to 1.46 billion barrels from
1.55 billion.
    The company said U.S. liquids production averaged 660,000
barrels per day last year, down from 714,000 in 1985, with
about 44 pct of the decline -- some 24,000 barrels per day --
representing high-cost production shut-in or curtailed in
response to the decline in crude oil prices during 1986.
    Texaco said its natural gas reserves totaled 8.16 trillion
cubic feet at year end, down from 8.87 trillion cubic feet at
the end of 1985.

<title>UNOCAL &lt;UCL&gt; PLANS INCREASE IN CAPITAL SPENDING</title>
<dateline>    LOS ANGELES, March 25 - </dateline>Unocal Corp said it intends to
increase its spending for capital projects to 929 mln dlrs in
1987, eight pct more than the 862 mln spent in 1986.
    The company said in its annual report that it would
increase spending for exploration and development of petroleum
resources by about three pct to 614 mln dlrs from 1986's 595
mln dlrs, assuming oil prices hold around current levels.
    The planned spending for exploration and production in 1987
remains well below the 1.1 billion dlrs spent in 1985, Unocal
said.
    The company's proved developed and undeveloped reserves of
crude oil rose slightly in 1986, Unocal said. Net crude oil and
condensate reserves were 752 mln bbls as of Dec 31, 1986,
compared to 751 mln bbls at the end of 1985, Unocal said.
    The company said its net crude oil and condensate
production averaged 248,200 barrels per day in 1986 compared to
251,300 bpd in 1985.
    Unocal said its worldwide natural gas reserves were 6.07
billion cubic feet in 1986 compared to 1985's 6.19 billion. Net
natural gas output averaged 976 mln cubic feet per day in 1986,
down 10 pct from 1985's 1,084 mln, the company said.
    Unocal said its average sales prices for crude oil was
12.67 dlrs a barrel worldwide in 1986 compared to 23.81 dlrs in
1985, and its average sales price for natural gas was 2.03 dlrs
per thousand cubic feet in 1986 against 2.24 dlrs in 1985.
    Average production costs for crude oil and natural gas
declined nearly 30 pct to 3.41 dlrs per bbl of oil equivalent
in 1986 from 4.81 dlrs in 1985, Unocal said.
    In the annual report, the company called for imposition of
an oil import fee by the U.S. government to set a floor price
of about 25 dlrs a barrel for crude oil.
    ""Simply stabilizing prices at about 18 dlrs per barrel    
will not materialy slow the drop in U.S. production or the rise
in imports,"" Chairman Fred Hartley said in the annual report.
    ""Without decisive action in Washington, this nation will
once again become a hostage to OPEC's plans and policies,""
Hartley said.

<title>PENNZOIL (PZL) WILLING TO SETTLE TEXACO (TX) LAWSUIT</title>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, March 25 - </dateline>Pennzoil Co said it had not yet
received any ""meaningful settlement offer"" from Texaco Inc but
added that the company remained willing to consider proposals
to settle the 10.2 billion dlr jury judgment it won against
Texaco.
    In its newly-released annual report to shareholders,
Pennzoil said it expected the Texas state court judgment, which
was upheld by a state appeals court on February 12, to be
upheld if appealed again.
    ""To date, Pennzoil has yet to receive any meaningful
settlement offer from Texaco, though it remains open to any
realistic effort to settle the matter,"" Pennzoil chairman Hugh
Liedtke said in the annual report.
    Pennzoil also said it had budgeted 212 mln dlrs for capital
spending in 1987, a drop from the 233 mln dlrs spent last year.
    Proved U.S. and foreign reserves of natural gas declined to
964 billion cubic feet last year, from 1.01 trillion cubic feet
in 1985, because of a virtual halt in its exploration program,
Pennzoil said. Its crude oil reserves dropped to 140 mln
barrels from 158 mln barrels in 1985.
     The Houston-based company said it sold an average of 339
mln cubic feet of domestic natural gas each day last year, a 17
pct drop from 1985. The average sales price for gas dropped by
60 cents per mcf to 2.16 dlrs per mcf, Pennzoil said.
    U.S. crude oil and gas liquids production last year fell to
an average of 33,290 barrels per day from 34,102 barrels per
day in 1985.
    The company's total revenues in 1986 declined to 482.3 mln
dlrs, from 762.5 mln dlrs the previous year. Operating income
in 1986 fell more than 80 pct, to 38.0 mln dlrs.
    Pennzoil said its goals for 1987 included development of
its Point Arguello oilfield off the California coast, to
maintain current production levels in its Bluebell-Altamont
Field in Utah and to drill for prospects in the Gulf of
Mexico's Mobile Bay area.
    ""Production should begin late in the year from the Harvest
Platform in the Santa Maria Basin offshore California,"" the
company said. ""Pennzoil's share of this production initially
should be five thousand barrels a day, increasing to a peak of
15 thousand barrels a day, net, by 1989.""
    In its sulphur business, Pennzoil said production totaled
2.1 mln long tons last year, a decline of 18 pct from 1985. The
average sales price also declined, to 138.25 dlrs per long ton
from 141.05 dlrs in 1985.
    ""The long term outlook for our sulphur operations remains
bright,"" the company said. ""We expect sulphur's pricing
structure to strengthen during the current year, probably in
the third and fourth quarters.""

<title>LATIN OIL PRODUCERS TO MEET IN CARACAS</title>
<dateline>    CARACAS, March 25 - </dateline>Five regional oil producing nations
will gather in Caracas tommorrow for a two-day meeting expected
to center on ways to combat proposals for a U.S. tax on
imported petroleum, the Venezuela's ministry of energy and
mines said.
    Oil ministers from Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, Ecuador and
Venezuela will be on hand for the fifth meeting of the informal
group of Latin American and Caribbean Petroleum Exporters,
formed in 1983, it said. Colombia will also attend for the
first time, as an observer nation, the ministry said.
    Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said
the conference has no set agenda but one entire session Friday
will be devoted to proposals for a tax on imported oil.
    Two of the group's members, Venezuela and Mexico, are
second and third largest foreign suppliers of oil to the United
States, respectively, following Canada.
    Venezuela, concerned about the effect such a tax would have
on its exports, undertook a diplomatic push to coordinate
strategy against such measures. In February, Canadian Energy
Minister Marcel Masse was invited to Caracas for talks with
Hernandez on proposals for an oil import tax.

<title>BP&lt;BP&gt; OFFER RAISES EXPECTATIONS FOR OIL VALUES</title>
<author>    By PATTI DOMM, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </dateline>British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay
7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has
signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said.
    ""I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and
clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they
think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,""
said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
    BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70
dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already
own.
    ""It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the
war and oil prices are not going to crack,"" said Prescott, Ball
and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier.
    ""Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the
energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those
that are acquisition targets,"" Lazier said.
    One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an
energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl
Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a
Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock.
    Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms
falling into takeover situations for several years, with the
exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp &lt;AHC&gt;. He said most of
the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking
which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point
that they have become unattractive.
    U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon
Corp &lt;XON&gt; rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp &lt;CHV&gt; jumped
1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco &lt;TX&gt; climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal
Corp &lt;UCL&gt; rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY&gt;
climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp &lt;AN&gt; rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4.
    Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to
71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4.
Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its
offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it
would not raise the 70 dlr bid.
    British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8.
    Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in
the first place indicates that the British oil giant has
changed its outlook for the oil industry.
    Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the
more bearish positions on oil prices.
    ""They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a
barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty
retreat from that point of view,"" Margoshes said.
    ""They are more appropriately today looking more
optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs
(long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that
will be exceeded,"" Margoshes said.
    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was
trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel.
    Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy
up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when
oil prices were falling last year.
    They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly
more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil
field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in
the Alaskan North Slope.
    Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely
attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and
has hard-to-replace reserves.
    ""I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to
increase their position in the U.S. market,"" Dean Witter
analyst Eugene Nowak said.
    Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the
British government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP
stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding
sometime in the year beginning April one.
    After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserves
would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is
held in the U.S.
    ""The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it
into the United States. No other market can handle all that
stock,"" said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua.
    In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on
revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the year
earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs.

<title>NEXT FEW MONTHS CRUCIAL FOR OIL - HERNANDEZ</title>
<dateline>     CARACAS, March 26 - </dateline>Energy and Mines Minister Arturo
Hernandez Grisanti today told a meeting of regional oil
exporters the next few months will be critical to efforts to
achieve price recovery and stabilize the market.
     Hernandez said while OPEC and non-OPEC nations have
already made some strides in their efforts to strengthen the
market, the danger of a reversal is always present.
    ""March and the next two or three months will be a really
critical period,"" Hernandez said. He said, ""We will be able to
define a movement, either towards market stability and price
recovery or, depending on the market, a reversal.""
    Earlier this week, Hernandez said Venezuela's oil price has
averaged just above 16 dlrs a barrel for the year to date. If
OPEC achieves its stated goal of an 18 dlrs a barrel average
price, he said, Venezuela's should move up to 16.50 dlrs.
    Hernandez spoke today at the opening of the fifth
ministerial meeting of the informal group of Latin American and
Caribbean oil exporters, formed in 1983.
    Ministers from member states Ecuador, Mexico,
Trinidad-Tobago and Venezuela are attending the two day
conference, while Colombia is present for the first time as an
observer.
    Hernandez defined the meeting as an informal exchange of
ideas about the oil market. However, the members will also
discuss ways to combat proposals for a tax on imported oil
currently before the U.S. Congress.
    Following the opening session, the group of ministers met
with President Jaime Lusinchi at Miraflores, the presidential
palace. The delegations to the conference are headed by
Hernandez of Venezuela, Energy Minister Javier Espinosa of
Ecuador, Energy Minister Kelvin Ramnath of Trinidad-Tobago,

<title>OIL EXECUTIVES SEE GRADUAL RISE IN PRICES</title>
<dateline>     HOUSTON, March 26 - </dateline>Top executives with Tenneco Corp &lt;TGT&gt;
and Sabine Corp &lt;SAB&gt; said they expected world oil prices to
gradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance on
imports of oil from the Middle East grows.
     ""I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a
trend of gradually increasing prices,"" C.W. Nance, president of
Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production, told a meeting of the
Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association.
     Nance predicted that by 1990, the Organization of
Producing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the
rate of 80 pct of capacity.
    The gain will come largely through increased imports to the
United States, he said.
    ""They will be able to raise the price again but I do not
think they will raise it as much as they did in 1979,"" Nance
said. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected.
     Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predicted
that world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20
dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in
1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb
from a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between
1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988.
     ""Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in
increased demand,"" Shoup said, referring to the gas industry's
outlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law
prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants
and utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15
pct, he said.
     Tenneco's Nance also said that some U.S. cities may
experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next
winter because of the industry's reduced deliverability.
     Tenneco's gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20
pct during 1986, he said.
     ""This does not mean the gas bubble is gone,"" Nance said.
""We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question is
how broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or three
years before we start to climb out?""
      J.C. Walter of &lt;Walter Oil and Gas Corp&gt;, said the recent
improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent
producers to begin new onshore drilling projects.
     ""If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlr
per mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshore
exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by
independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal,"" Walter said.
     He suggested that some independents may instead turn to
exploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-out
agreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have held
finding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel,
Walter said.

<title>PAPANDREOU SAYS GREEKS READY FOR AGGRESSORS</title>
<dateline>    ATHENS, March 27 - </dateline>Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou
said today that the Greek armed froces were ready to tackle any
aggressors following the sailing of a Turkish research vessel
and warships towards disputed waters in the Aegean Sea.
    Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens ""the
military readiness of our country is able now to give a very
hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out
military actions.""
    He said the activities of the research vessel could be
aimed at partitioning the Aegean.
    ""The air force, navy and army are in a state of alert,""
General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General
Staff, told a news conference.
    He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an
unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters
in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning.
    Ergenc told Reuters later that all leave had been cancelled
for members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area.
    The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed the
state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil in
international waters around three Greek islands off Turkey.
     Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes over areas
of the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus.
    The latest row erupted when the Greek government said last
month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium
which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos
and would drill in the same area after the takeover.
    Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed a
government decision that Turkey should protect its interests
""because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean in
violation of international agreements.""
    Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of the
vessels, he said ""If there is an attack, it is clear what has to
be done. An attack on a warship is a cause for war."" But he
added ""We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by the
military are directed towards protecting our rights.""
    Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights
in the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the
dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
    Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told
reporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions
Athens had attached.
    In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the
Turkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations ""we will
hinder it, of course not with words, as it cannot be stopped
with words.""
    Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and
navy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesman
Yannis Roubatis did not confirm the move, saying only ""The Greek
fleet is not at its naval base.""
    Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct
of the areas proposed for research were on the Greek
continental shelf.
    Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part
in orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to
negotiate with Turkey, the Greek government would not accept
it.
    Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not
negotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in
the Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus.
    He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be
possible for Greece to discuss the future of American military
bases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases
in Greece in the event of war, Papandreou replied ""Obviously,
and perhaps even before the war.""

was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos and
would drill in the same area after the takeover.

<title>NATO CALLS ON GREECE AND TURKEY TO AVOID FORCE</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, March 27 - </dateline>Greece and Turkey's NATO allies today
called on both countries to avoid any action that could
aggravate an explosive situation in the Aegean and ""avoid
recourse to force at all costs.""
    After an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors, a statement
was issued saying ""the present situation damages the interests
of Greece and Turkey, and of the Alliance as a whole.""
    Secretary-General Lord Carrington also offered himself as a
mediator in the dispute on the Western Alliance's southern
flank.
    The meeting was called after reports that warships of both
countries were sailing towards a disputed oil exploration zone
of the Aegean.
    The statement said the tensions in the area had reached a
serious level and called on both countries to begin immediate
discussions. ""Any intensification would make things worse,"" it
added.
    No attempt was made at the meeting to resolve the complex
dispute which was aimed at damage-limitation. Carrington said,
""I am of course anxious to help in any way I can, provided that
both Greece and Turkey, and the other allies, wish me to do so.""

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 27 - </dateline>The United States said it was doing
what it could to ease tension in the Aegean as Greek and
Turkish warships headed for a possible clash over oil drilling
rights on the sea's continental shelf.
    State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters,
""We have urged both sides to exercise restraint and avoid any

    ""In the light of the most recent developments, we are
consulting with the parties and with other interested allies on

    Redman declined to elaborate on what Washington was doing,
but he said an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors in
Brussels on the subject was only one path it was pursuing.
    He also refused to say which side was to blame for the
renewed confrontation, saying Washington was still trying to
ascertain all the facts, as Prime minister Andreas Papanderou
said Greece was prepared to tackle any aggressor.
    ""The crucial point here is that these are two friends and
allies. We don't want to see tension rise and we are doing what
we can to see if we can help here,"" Redman said.

<title>PAPANDREOU SHOWS ""RESTRICTED OPTIMISM"" OVER CRISIS</title>
<dateline>    ATHENS, March 28 - </dateline>Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou
expressed ""restricted optimism"" about a crisis with Turkey over
disputed oil rights in the Aegean Sea.
    Papandreou was speaking to reporters after briefing
opposition political leaders on the latest developments in the
row as a Turkish research ship escorted by warships and combat
aircraft headed for the Aegean.
    He and other political leaders spoke of qualified optimism
following a statement by Turkish Premier Turgut Ozal last night
that the research vessel would not enter disputed waters as
previously annnounced unless Greek vessels did so.
    The Prime Minister declined to answer reporters' questions
about an announcement last night that Greece had asked the
United States to suspend operations at one of the American
military bases here due to the crisis.
    But Opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis told reporters
he thought the suspension would be temporary until the crisis
is resolved. A U.S. Defence Department official in Washington
said the station was still functioning.
    Communist Party leader Harilaos Florakis said here ""the
climate is calmer today.""
    Greek newspapers reported that the Greek army, navy and air
force had been moved to strategic Greek islands in the Aegean
and to the land border with Turkey at the Evros River.
    But there was no official word on military movements apart
from a comment by the government spokesman that the Greek navy
was no longer in port.
    The United States, NATO and the United Nations all called
on Greece and Turkey to exercise restraint.
    Greek U.N. Representative Mihalis Dounas said in a letter
to the secretary-general that the dispute was of a legal nature
and could be settled in the International Court in the Hague.

<title>BANK SEES MODEST RECOVERY IN GULF ARAB ECONOMIES</title>
<dateline>    ABU DHABI, March 29 - </dateline>The Emirates Industrial Bank has
predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states
following higher oil revenues.
    A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said
total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from
33.5 billion in 1986.
    The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
    The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil
prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain
overall group production.
    These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight
dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs.
    ""All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in
the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected
growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,""
the study said.
    It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher
budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past
recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts.
    The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise
to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year.
    It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined
trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in
1985.
    The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic product
to 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, it
added.

<title>INDONESIA LIMITS OIL PRICE IMPACT-FINANCE MINISTER</title>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, March 30 - </dateline>Indonesia has minimised the economic
impact of falling oil prices, kept inflation within limits and
boosted exports, Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said.
    Indonesia was badly hit by last year's steep plunge in
crude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half.
    But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling
President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in
the financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct the
previous year.
    Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said,
although he did not give complete figures.
    The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general
elections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber,
palm oil, tin, timber and coffee.
    Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the
appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against
the dollar, which increased Indonesia's debt repayments.
    He said the economy would have suffered more from the world
economic recession if the government had not devalued the
rupiah by 31 pct last September.
    In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Post
said the government must press ahead with measures to
deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports.
    The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were
needed to finance not only imports but also the country's
growing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs.
    ""About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due
within the next three to five years and will steadily increase
the debt servicing burden,"" the paper said.
    However, end-investors were seen bargain hunting in
expectation of a further yen interest rate decline, dealers
said.
    Most dealers were cautious in the face of the dollar's
nosedive today and the possibility of a U.S. Interest rate
rebound to halt further dollar depreciation.
    A 4.7 pct coupon and volume of 1,400 billion yen for the
April 10-year bond proposed by the Finance Ministry this
afternoon were taken favourably by the market.

<title>GREECE SCRAPS U.S. BASE CLOSURE REQUEST</title>
<dateline>    ATHENS, March 30 - </dateline>Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has
withdrawn a request to Washington to suspend operations at an
American army base near Athens as a Greek-Turkish row over oil
rights in the Aegean eased.
    A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened to
tackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea kept
to Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potential
clash.
    Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefing
opposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday.
    The Greek government later withdrew Friday's request to
Washington to close down its telecommunications base at Nea
Makri, north of Athens, saying that the reasons which had
prompted it to make the request were no longer valid.
    Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece has
the right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its
national interests are threatened.
    The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would
search for oil round three Greek islands off its coast
following an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill
east of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led
oil consortium operating in the northern Aegean.
    Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement
under which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the
Aegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled.
Athens says it considers the accord inactive.
    The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had
received an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out
oil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declined
comment on the statement.
    Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take the
long-standing continental shelf dispute to the International
Court of Justice at The Hague.
    Conservative opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis said
he had urged Papandreou to accept an offer from NATO General
Secretary Lord Carrington to help resolve the row.

<title>CRUDE OIL NETBACKS UP IN U.S., MEDITERRANEAN</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </dateline>Crude oil netback values in complex
refineries rose slightly in the U.S. and the Mediterranean 
last Friday from the previous week but were lower elsewhere,
according to calculations by Reuters Pipeline.
    The soft tone to refining margins reflects large worldwide
stocks of petroleum products and thin trading activity, traders
said.
    In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by as much as
26 cts a barrel for West Texas Intermediate, an increase of 1.4
pct from the previous Friday, while sour crudes, such as
Alaska North Slope, were up one pct.

generally lower with Brent valued at 18.89 dlrs, off 30 cts
from the previous friday, and Bonny Light was off 17 cts to
19.58 dlrs a barrel.
    Refinery netbacks in Singapore were also lower, with
heavier and sour crudes weakest. Arab Heavy dropped 10 cts to
16.63 dlrs a barrel and Dubai was off 12 cts to 18.09 dlrs.
    On the U.S. West Coast, however, netback values for ANS CIF

<title>LOWER REFINERY OPERATIONS SEEN PRODUCING PROFITS</title>
<author>    By BERNICE NAPACH, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, March 30 - </dateline>U.S. refiners will have to
reduce operations if they want to be profitable this year, said
industry officials attending the National Petroleum Refiners
Association meeting here.
     ""If the refining sector can discipline itself to refine
about 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day, we have a chance to
pull down inventories to acceptable levels by the second
quarter, said Archie Dunham, executive vice president of
petroluem products at Conoco Inc
    ""If not, the industry will have a tough 1987,"" he added.
     Last week's American Petroleum Institute report said that
U.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity,
with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the week
ended March 20.
     The API said that with the higher crude oil runs, 
distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-ago
levels. Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2
mln barrels above year-ago levels. Distillate stocks, at 108.7
mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year's level, the
API said.
     Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp
&lt;CNP&gt; told Reuters that unless refining and marketing return to
profitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstream
operations to produce an acceptable level of earnings.
     ""The jump in refining capacity is a concern if it
continues,"" said Kenneth Buckler, executive vice president of
refining and marketing at &lt;Total Petroleum Co&gt;, a U.S.
subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France.
     Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity given
the current level of demand but the operating level should
increase as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter,
Buckler said.
     Dunham said the potential operable capacity of U.S.
refineries should also be cut about 500,000 barrels of crude
per day. ""I expect to see the shutdown of more small refineries
over the next five years,"" he said, adding that these
facilities refine between 10,000 and 30,000 barrels of crude
oil per day. The API said U.S. operations have the capacity to
refine 15.6 mln bpd of crude.

<title>VENEZUELA WANTS TO BOOST ITS REFINING CAPACITY</title>
<dateline>    SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, March 30 - </dateline>Venezuela's state oil
company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. wants to raise its
worldwide refining capacity by 150,000 barrels of per day, a
company official attending the National Petroleum Refiners
Association meeting here said.
    He declined to be identified but said PdVSA has the
capacity to refine about 650,000 bpd of crude oil from refining
centers
in Venezuela, Sweden, West Germany, Belgium, and the United
States. The company recently purchased a 50 pct stake in the
Corpus Christi, Texas refinery of Champlin Petroleum Co, a
subsidiary of Union Pacific Corp &lt;UNP&gt;.
    Earlier it bought a similar stake in the Lake Charles, La
refinery owned by Citgo Petroleum Corp, a unit of Southland
Corp &lt;SLC&gt;.
     According to the official, Venezuela is searching
worldwide for the additional refining capacity but he did not
mention where the company was looking. 
    Refineries abroad, he said, guarantee a refining outlet for
Venezuelan crude oil while ensuring stability of supply to
refiners.
    He said Venezuela currently  produces about 1.4 mln bpd of
crude oil, which is in line with its 1.495 bpd OPEC ceiling.

<title>EXXON (XON) SEES SYNFUELS ROLE BY YEAR 2000</title>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, March 30 - </dateline>Development of costly shale oil,
liquified coal and other kinds of synthetic fuels, halted in
recent years because of cheap and abundant petroleum supplies,
will become economic again when world oil prices top 30 dlrs a
barrel, an Exxon Co USA executive said.
    Joe McMillan, a senior vice president, told Reuters after
addressing a Houston meeting of the American Institute of
Chemical Engineers, ""By early in the next century, synthetics
should play a significant role in this country's energy
supply.""
    McMillan also told reporters at a news conference that he
believed synthetic fuels would become economic to develop when
world oil prices reached a 30 to 40 dlr a barrel price range.
    ""You're talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oil
prices, but I think that time is coming and we've got to be
prepared,"" McMillan said.
    He predicted U.S. oil demand would rise by about one pct
annually in the next few years while the nation fails to
replace its oil reserves through exploration. By the turn of
the century, world oil prices will be significantly higher
because of declining supplies, McMillan said.
    Ashland Oil, Inc. chairman John Hall, who also spoke at the
meeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to help
spur development of synthetic fuels.
    The United States, Hall said, has nearly 500 billion tons
of demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple that
of all the world's known oil reserves.
    ""We must encourage research now in order to make synfuels
competitive later,"" Hall said. The average lead time for
development of a shale oil or liquified coal project is between
five and ten years.
    Until last year, the federal government had subsidized
synfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., a
research program created during the Carter Administration with
the goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrels
of oil.
    The corporation was shut down last April when Congress
refused to continue funding its eight billion dlr budget
because of uneconomic projects based on forecasts of 50 dlrs a
barrel oil and 10 dlr per mcf natural gas during this decade.

<title>U.S. SHOULD REASSESS MIDEAST POLICY - ANALYST</title>
<dateline>     SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, March 30 - </dateline>The U.S. should reassess
its Mideast policy in light of its rising dependence on
imported oil, according to Charles Ebinger of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.
     ""The prospect of rising dependence on oil imports from the
Gulf, and the recent revelations of the Tower Commission
report, mandate more than ever before the need for a
fundamental reassessment of U.S. interests in the Middle East,""
Ebinger said.
     He remarks were made in an address to the National
Petroleum Refiners Association meeting.
     ""Although in the short run it is difficult to see a direct
link between Arab anger and threats to oil supplies, in the
current environment it will be increasingly difficult for
moderate Arab leaders to be seen as friendly to U.S.
interests,"" Ebinger said.
     Oil traders said threats to oil supplies has kept crude
oil prices strong recently although some believe prices will be
weaker if demand falls in the spring.
    But William Randol, analyst at First Boston Corp, said
crude oil prices will hold  near current levels this spring.
    There will be no spring downturn, said Randol, speaking at
the annual refiner meeting. He said there is a 40 pct chance
that crude oil prices could move higher in the second half of
the year, following an OPEC meeting scheduled for late June.
    He said he expects OPEC will extend its current agreement
to restrict production.
    OPEC will renew its production pricing agreement in June
because the value of the oil exports of the OPEC producers  has
declined along with the U.S. dollar, Randol said.
    OPEC oil exports are priced in U.S. dollars, and the dollar
has fallen about 30 pct in the last 18 months.
    Randol said U.S. crude oil imports will increase 3.5 to
four mln barrels per day by 1990 as consumption rises 1.5 to
two mln bpd, and supplies decline two mln bpd.

<title>CSR SELLS OIL/GAS INTERESTS, BIDS TO EXTEND SUGAR</title>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, March 31 - </dateline>CSR Ltd has made a bold move in selling
its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and
ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share
analysts said.
    CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas
interests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would instead
sell them to Exxon Corp unit Esso Exploration and Production
Australia Inc for 985 mln dlrs.
    In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest
sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it
does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd.
    A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and
300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright CSR had given
itself the cash to all but eliminate its debt and embark on an
ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions
of sugar and building products, analysts said.
    The Pioneer Sugar investment would give CSR by far the
largest stake in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry
and access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in
the country, they said. Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend
acceptance of the bid, through which CSR would benefit from the

<title>EXXON &lt;XON&gt; OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION ROSE IN 1986</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </dateline>Exxon Corp said in its annual report
that it raised production in 1986 although it did not replace
all oil and gas produced.
    The company said that it added about four pct to production
bringing it to 1.8 mln bpd, the highest level since 1979, based
largely on increased production of oil overseas but additions
to its reserves from new discoveries and reserve acquisitions
did not replace all of the oil and gas produced.
    The company said that the average price for oil and gas
declined 41 pct in 1986 from the previous year sparking a 38
pct decline in its earnings from exploration and production.
    Exxon's earnings from exploration and production in 1986
fell to 3.1 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.
    Exxon said that its principal gains in production came from
the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the North Sea, Malaysia and from
oil sands in Canada.
    Exxon also said that it acquired 11.2 mln acres for
expoloration spread over 10 countries including the U.S, Europe
and the Far East.
    But capital expenditures for exploration and production
were cut to 4.6 billion dlrs from 7.6 billion the previous year
and further reductions were expected in 1987.
    Exxon said that its net share of crude oil and natural gas
liquids produced from offshore fields in the North Sea reached
a new high of 422,000 bpd.
    The light, sweet crudes produced from these North Sea
fields also gave the company trading gains as Exxon was able to
sell much of this crude and replace it with cheaper, lower
quality crude oil for its refineries which have been upgraded
over the past several years.
    The trading gains and lower acquisition costs gave Exxon
more of a spread in its refinery operations and added to
earnings gains from refining and marketing.
    Exxon said earnings from refining and marketing operations
rose to nearly two billion dlrs in 1986, up from 872 mln dlrs
in 1985.
    The company said petroleum sales slipped slightly to 4.043
mln barrels per day from 4.082 mln bpd in 1985 while crude runs
rose to 3.0 mln bpd from 2.9 mln bpd the previous year.
    Exxon's refinery operations benefited from a three year 500
mln dlr upgrading program to its Baytown, Texas refinery
completed last October and an 850 mln dlr upgrading project in
Rotterdam both of which emphasize utilizing lower grade crudes
to extract higher proportions of light products.

<title>U.S. DISTILLATE, GASOLINE INVENTORIES SEEN LOWER</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </dateline>Tonight's American Petroleum Institute
weekly inventory report is expected to show moderate drawdowns
in distillates and gasoline stocks for the week ended March 27,
analysts and traders said.
    They said they expect gasoline stocks to fall three mln
barrels or less and heating oil inventories to drop between 1.3
and four mln barrels.
    Some analysts see crude stocks falling by as much as six
mln barrels, while others think they could go up as much as 3.5
mln barrels. Crude oil runs are expected to be unchanged from
the previous week or slightly higher or lower.
    For the week ended March 20, the API said gasoline stocks
fell 2.7 mln barrels. Mosts analysts expect a modest draw for
the week ended March 27. They said stocks could fall between
700,000 and three mln barrels. Some said there is also a chance
gasoline stocks will be unchanged.
    API said distillate stocks dropped four mln barrels for the
week ended March 20. Analysts and traders generally predict a
similar or smaller depletion for last week. They said stock
levels could drop 1.3 to four mln barrels.
    The analysts attribute product stockdraws to seasonal
factors but they said crude direction is harder to call.
    Crude inventories rose 8.5 mln barrels in the week ended
March 20, API said. Analysts are looking for build of between
3.5 mln barrels to a six mln barrel draw for the week ended
March 27.
    API reported the amount of refinery capacity utilized up
three pct for the week ended March 20. Analysts said
utilization could have remained unchanged, or rose or fell by
less than one pct for the week ended March 27.

<dateline>    TORONTO, March 31 - </dateline>Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct-owned by Exxon
Corp &lt;XON&gt;, is negotiating with it major crude oil suppliers
concerning the effects of a trial deregulation of Alberta's
shut-in crude oil production, scheduled to be implemented on
June 1, a company spokesman said.
    ""From our point of view, it's a question of entering into
negotiations or discussions to make appropriate changes to
contracts to reflect the changes that are going to take place
on June 1,"" spokesman John Cote told Reuters in reply to a
query.
    Commenting on published reports that Imperial had suspended
its oil supply contracts, Cote said: ""It's not a question of
cancelling or suspending any of the agreements at this point.""
    On June 1, Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board
will lift its crude oil marketing prorationing system,
regulating shut-in light and medium crude production, on a
trial basis to the end of 1987.
    Under the new system, producers and refiners will be
allowed to negotiate volumes of shut-in oil to be delivered
under purchase contracts.
    Shut-in crude is the surplus between the total amount of
oil being produced and the amount being purchased by refiners.
    ""We have talked to a number of our major suppliers, and
we've discussed the upcoming change with them, but nothing has
been finalized,"" Imperial's manager of western crude supply Gary
Strong said.
    Under Alberta's trial system, Imperial wants to match a
reasonable supply of crude against the company's forecast
demand for its refineries, Strong said.
    ""We have to know what they have and how that relates to what
we need in total,"" he said.

<title>CLOSURE OF BP SWEDEN REFINERY FORECAST</title>
<dateline>    STOCKHOLM, April 3 - </dateline>A Swedish Finance Ministry committee
forecast that British Petroleum Plc &lt;BP.L&gt; may have to close
its refinery in Gothenburg because of an anticipated worsening
of the Swedish petroleum industry's competitiveness.
    It said in a report that the future of the Swedish refining
business was bleak due to the steady drop in domestic oil
consumption since the mid-1970s, a possible tightening of rules
on sulphur content and competition from Norway's Mongstad
facility of &lt;Den Norske Stats Olieselskab&gt; (Statoil) &lt;STAT.OL&gt;
when its expansion is completed in the 1990s.
    The committee said the BP refinery, which lacks a
de-sulphurisation plant, was likely to be closed or sold unless
costly investments were made to enhance the facility's capacity
to refine a broader range of products.
    But the committee noted that capacity utilisation had in
recent years been above that of the European refining industry
on average. The BP plant, in which Sweden's state-owned &lt;OK
Petroleum AB&gt; has a 22 pct, started up in 1967 and has an
annual capacity of 4.7 mln tonnes.

<title>CANADA OIL INDUSTRY SET FOR RECOVERY - ANALYSTS</title>
<author>    By LARRY WELSH, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TORONTO, April 3 - </dateline>Firmer crude oil prices, government aid
packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil
industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry
analysts said.
    They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987
compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped
about 50 pct.
    On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to
their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at
record highs.
    ""This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the
part of the investment community that the outlook for the
industry for the future is extremely attractive,"" Peters and Co
Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said.
    Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies,
culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr
1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last
year's results, analysts said.
    ""But the financial statements are a snap shot and a
recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the
future,"" Gobert commented.
    The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41
companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15
at the end of 1986.
    Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of
Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A&gt;, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON&gt;, is
trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4.
    Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4.
Texaco Canada Inc &lt;TXC&gt;, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc &lt;TX&gt;, is
at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2.
    Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts
operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas
companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs
and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion
dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S.
dlrs a barrel. ""However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a
barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase
with cash flow 27 pct higher,"" analyst Plexman said.
    ""Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the
profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,""
he added.
    Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when
operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05
billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90
billion dlrs.
    But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold
recent gains and more government assistance is needed.
    Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans
Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987,
after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude
oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC
production accord will continue to support prices.
    However, several companies share the optimistic industry
outlook expressed by a majority of analysts.
    Shell Canada and &lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd&gt; forecast
improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this
week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels.
    ""The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not
robust,"" Texaco Canada said in its annual report.
    ""While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is
good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable,
continued volatility is likely,"" Texaco Canada added.
    In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have
pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels,
deferring most frontier exploration work.
    ""The industry is becoming very selective in investments,
very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,""
Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said.
    Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion
the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results.
    The most significant help came last September when the
federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax
(PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned.
    Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil
companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.
    The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow
decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further
exploration spending cuts, analysts said.
    ""For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely
necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that
were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably
more,"" Maciej said.

<title>IEA SEES ONE PCT GROWTH IN 1987 OECD OIL DEMAND</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, April 5 - </dateline>Growth in oil consumption in the Western
industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct
this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International
Energy Agency (IEA) said.
    Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around
one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in
its Monthly Oil Market Report.
    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are
higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be
below last year's 3.6 pct, it said.
    The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices
stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can
be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some
of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there
may be slightly less growth in transport fuels.
    IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at
428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.
This is about the same level as at the begining of the year.
    The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
the year which offset a reduction in stocks.
    It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell
by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the
year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but
a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.
    It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,
particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,
there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported
stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.
    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built
up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the
period.
    The year-on-year trend of government stock building is
continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more
or less in line with consumption, after declining for five
years, the IEA noted.
    Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6
mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January
1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption,
respectively.
    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April
1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to
94 days of consumption.
    World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln
bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.
    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5
mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from
centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.
    Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first
quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd
of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average
for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled
28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.
    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the
largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA
said.
    Saudi Arabia""s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd.

these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct.
    The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar
current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected.
    If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some of
the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said.
    IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD
area at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. This
is about the same as at the begining of the year.
    The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
the year which offset a reduction in stocks.
    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender
1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to
102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986.
    The year-on-year trend of government stock building is
continuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line
with consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said.
    Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put
at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one
and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.
    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down
from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to
94 days of consumption.
    The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company
stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first
quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of
400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in
March.
    And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw,
particulary for March, it said.
    As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also
been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the
IEA said.
    World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about
two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986.
    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd
in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally
Planned Economies, the IEA said.
    Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first
quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months
of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as
against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period.
    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest
factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.

<title>KUWAIT MAY RE-REGISTER GULF TANKERS - NEWSPAPER</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </dateline>Kuwait may re-register part of its
tanker fleet with foreign flag jurisdictions, including the
U.S. And USSR, in an attempt to protect them from Iranian
missile attacks in the Gulf war zone, U.S. Officials were
quoted by the New York Times as saying.
    The transfers would allow the country of registration to
escort Kuwaiti-owned ships in the Gulf. Kuwait had earlier
declined an offer of U.S. Naval escorts as too public an
admission of its need for protection, they said.
    Kuwait is also looking at flagging-out to European
registries, the officials said.
    Soviet flag tankers transporting Kuwaiti oil through the
Gulf may get Soviet escorts, the officials said.
    Kuwait had earlier considered having both USSR and U.S.
Escorts, but the U.S. Was unwilling to give the Soviet Union a
naval role in the region, the newspaper quoted the officials as
saying.
    Kuwait has backed Iraq in the seven-year war against Iran
and its ships have increasingly been the target of Iranian
attacks.
    The U.S. And Kuwait have been negotiating for over a month
on methods of protecting Kuwaiti ships.

<title>BP SCOTTISH REFINERY SET TO RESTART THIS WEEK</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 7 - </dateline>The British Petroleum &lt;BP.L&gt; Co Plc's
refinery at Grangemouth, Scotland, shut down after an explosion
and fire in the hydrocracker on March 22, will probably be back
in operation towards the week-end, a refinery spokesman said.
    He said the refinery will resume at about half its 178,500
barrels per day (bpd) capacity, as work on overhauling the
North Side of the complex, which began at the end of January,
will not be completed before the end of April.
    He said the refinery had been closed for longer than
originally expected due to the lengthy safety checks being
carried out prior to restarting.
    The explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed,
caused extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000
hydrocracker and the spokesman said today this unit would be
out of operation for several months. The remainder of the
refinery, including the 19,000 catalytic cracker, was
undamaged.
    He said inquiries into the accident, which happened while
the hydrocracker was not in operation, were continuing.
    In an earlier incident, two people were killed in an
explosion and fire at the refinery on March 13.

<title>KUWAIT SAID SEEKING FOREIGN PROTECTION FOR OIL</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </dateline>Kuwait has asked at least four
countries, including the United States, Soviet Union, Britain
and China, for temporary use of their flags or tankers to
protect Kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled Persian Gulf,
Reagan Administration officials said.
    The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait
wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet
registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new
""Silkworm"" missiles at superpower flags.
    The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to
international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using
the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the
mouth of the gulf.
    ""They (the Kuwaitis) have also asked Britain, China and
possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to
carry their oil,"" one of the administration officials, who asked
not to be identified, told Reuters.
    The United States is considering the request to temporarily
transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such a
move could create insurance and other problems, the officials
said.
    U.S. defense officials told Reuters yesterday that Kuwait
had decided for at least the time being not to accept a U.S.
offer to use American warships to escort its tankers in the
gulf, where both Iran and Iraq have been attacking shipping.

<title>COOPERATIVE ENERGY TESTS OIL AT TWO WELLS</title>
<dateline>    CALGARY, Alberta, April 7 - </dateline>&lt;Cooperative Energy Development
Corp&gt; said two exploratory oil wells in the Zama area of
Alberta tested 1,020 and 950 barrels a day, and will increase
the company's daily oil production by 30 pct.
    The company did not immediately elaborate on total
production figures.
    The wells, flowing oil from the Keg River formation, will
be constrained to combined production of about 450 barrels a
day to optimize reserve recovery, the company said.
    Permanent production facilities are being installed and the
wells will produce to pipeline by mid-April.

<title>SUPPLIES, MIDEAST TENSION FUEL GAINS IN OIL</title>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </dateline>Petroleum futures rallied today in a
market that was expecting declines in domestic supplies and
became further unsettled by escalated Mideast fighting.
    Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, with crude oil prices matching
life-of-contract highs. Crude for delivery in May closed 17
cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel.
    ""Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will
not remain there long if products are not strong,"" Robert
Murphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said.
    Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the
American Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domestic
inventories of petroleum products in a weekly report.
    Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in
the Iran-Iraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a new
offensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshore
oil fields and an oil export depot.
    Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and
silver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
    Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before the
close with support from the silver market, which was
approaching two-year highs, traders said.
    Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of
Trade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher.
    Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, and
the soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, which
is limiting supplies.
    In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projected
a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year.     Monday's
report that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for
export last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack
of farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders
said.
    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower.
    Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many
farmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather
than marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash sales
have been lighter than expected this week.
    The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, but
prices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as
speculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said.
    Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength
related to tight supplies.
    Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gains
past three-year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meat
packers to bid aggressively for available animals.
    However, some traders sold contracts to take profits after
the extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contract
soar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start
of the year.
    New York coffee futures closed higher on trade talk Brazil
would not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said.
