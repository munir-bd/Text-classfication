<title>FED'S HELLER SAYS MONETARY GROWTH TO BE SLOWER</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </dateline>Robert Heller, a member of the
Federal Reserve Board, said he expects ""more modest levels"" of
growth in the money supply this year.
    ""In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a
most desireable development,"" he said in a speech prepared for
delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange,
Calif.
    A text was released in Washington.
    He said the effect of lower inflation and financial
deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.
    ""Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest
levels,"" Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed
after mid-January.
    ""I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates
were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as
well,"" he added.
    Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.
    ""The pricing behavior of American producers in response to
price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial
for our economic future,"" he said.
    Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising
import prices would ""generalize the inflationary forces
emanating from the foreign trade sector"" and might not gain more
market share for U.S. producers.
    ""A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be
the result of such a behavior pattern,"" Heller warned.
    He said ""we at the Federal Reserve will have to be
disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy."" 
    Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal
discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather
than new taxes.
    ""The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle
inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in
international markets,"" Heller said.
    He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct
during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.
    A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with
Canada ""would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American
producers to compete more effectively in that country,"" Heller
said.

<title>U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 361 MLN DLRS</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </dateline>U.S. bank discount window borrowings
less extended credits averaged 361 mln dlrs a day in the week
to Wednesday, April 8, the Federal Reserve said.
    Total daily borrowings in the week fell 99 mln dlrs to 591
mln dlrs, with extended credits down 35 mln dlrs at 230 mln
dlrs. The week was the second half of the two-week statement
period that ended Wednesday. Net borrowings averaged 425 mln
dlrs in the first week of the period.
    Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on
April 8, the Fed said banks had average net free reserves of
447 mln dlrs.
    A Fed spokesman told a press conference that there were no
large one-day net misses in the Fed's estimates of reserves in
the week ended Wednesday.
    Of the week's borrowings, money center banks accounted for
65 pct, and small banks for almost 35 pct. On Wednesday, when
net borrowings were 1.36 billion dlrs and Fed funds averaged a
high 6.45 pct, money center banks accounted for more than 90
pct of the borrowing.
    Borrowings in the latest two weeks averaged 393 mln dlrs a
day, the highest since the statement period ended January 28.
    Float ranged from about 250 mln dlrs on Thursday to between
one and 1.25 billion dlrs on Monday and Tuesday.
    The spokesman said Monday's float included 500 mln dlrs in
holdover float at one Fed branch due to mechanical problems.
    About 500 mln dlrs of Tuesday's float reflected
non-weather-related transportation float in one Eastern Reserve
bank.
    As-of adjustments ranged from minus 500 mln dlrs on Monday,
when cash letter errors at two eastern reserve banks were
corrected, to plus 500 mln dlrs on Thursday, when a correction
was made to unposted funds at a single bank.
    In the first half of the statement period ended Wednesday,
banks held excess reserves on the first four days of the week
but ran a deficit on Wednesday.
    In the second week, they ran a deficit on Thursday, Friday
and Monday but held excess reserves on the final two days.

<title>GERMAN INSTITUTES WARN ON MONEY SUPPLY</title>
<dateline>    BONN, April 13 - </dateline>Four of West Germany's five leading
economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary
growth threatened a resurgence of inflation.
    But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,
echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said
the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not
necessarily threaten stability.
    The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which
three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in
GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.
    The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in
view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has
shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price
rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.
    Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may
seem exaggerated, they said.
    ""But it has often turned out in the past that the price
climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into
a restrictive policy,"" they said.
    The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are
less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.
    The four institutes disputed the view that monetary
expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic
investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market
investments following lower interest rates.
    ""Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of
central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a
smaller expansion of money supply,"" they said.
    A return to growth and stability did not require
spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with
open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid
an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.
    The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be
focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of
uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic
weakness other factors should be taken into account.
    Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts
and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation
speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat
in itself to price stability.
    The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth
reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the
falling mark.

Japan's broadly-defined M-2 money supply average plus

    Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs rose a preliminary 8.8 pct in
January/March 1987 compared with a nine pct rise a year
earlier, it said.
    The bank said the forecast rise is due to an increase in
floating deposits due to recent low interest rates and a shift
to private banks from the Bank of Japan of 400-1,000 billion
yen by the recently privatised Japanese Railways.

<title>FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY</title>
<author>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 23 - </dateline>U.S. banking data released today are
too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary
policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the
Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,
economists said.
    ""It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount
window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate
average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent
with a modest tightening,"" said Dana Johnson of First Chicago
Corp.
    Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that
the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.
    Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were
935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week
statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of
December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.
    Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion
dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this
year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the
Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in
reserves than the Fed had anticipated.
    However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed
is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than
witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have
forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.
    First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week
ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,
partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the
proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to
pay annual income taxes.
    As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the
reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.
    Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion
dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists
said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the
projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to
add reserves too late.
    Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently
left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which
to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists
said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos
outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add
even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.
    ""It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as
much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,""
said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.
    McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting
discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,
equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.
    After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not
tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,
economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging 
overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the
statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.
    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that
the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's
figures, he said, ""It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving
toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture.""
    Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8
pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate
unless the dollar's fall gathers pace.
    Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political
opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time
when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to
reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.

<title>AUSTRALIA'S M-3 MONEY SUPPLY RISE 1.5 PCT IN MARCH</title>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, April 24 - </dateline>Australia's M-3 money supply growth was
1.5 pct in March and 11.3 pct in the 12 months to March, the
Reserve Bank said.
    This compared with a revised rise of 0.5 pct in February
and 11.1 pct in the year to end-February.
    The Reserve Bank said the M-3 data for March was affected
by the start of the operations of &lt;National Mutual Royal
Savings Bank Ltd&gt;, which has resulted in the transfer of
deposits (equivalent to around 1.5 pct of m-3) from the United
Permanent Building Society to National Mutual Royal Savings
Bank Ltd.
    The Reserve Bank said M-3 money supply in March was 110.77
billion Australian dlrs compared with a revised 109.11 billion
in February and 99.48 billion in March, 1986.
    M-3 is deposits of the private sector held by trading and

<title>FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY</title>
<author>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </dateline>New U.S. Banking data suggest the
Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path
and is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists
said.
    But they also said that if money supply growth remains
weak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline
suggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its
credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary
policy.
    A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a
forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June
8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a
decline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs
to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.
    Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for
the week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has
fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,
economists said.
    ""M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,"" said Bill Sullivan
of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
    While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of
economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned
the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth
in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen
as better gauges of economic growth.
    Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both
measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's
5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.
    If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,
concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,
could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.
    ""Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open
market position? No,"" Sullivan said. ""But does this mean the end
of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes.""
    Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings
of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period
were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had
targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.
    But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day
net miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher
borrowings target would probably have been reached.
    A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in
auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,
while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has
helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.
    ""If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed
easing at some point,"" he said.
    Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little
attention to weak money supply growth. ""It has been a number of
years since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the
economy,"" one said. ""I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is
falling apart and the Fed should ease.""
    Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a
prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary
policy.
    They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates
for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and
higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke
off econmomic growth.
    But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late
April. ""The Fed has to determine if this represents a
fundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives
them more room to ease,"" he said.
