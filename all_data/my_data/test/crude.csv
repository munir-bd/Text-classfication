<title>JAPAN TO REVISE LONG-TERM ENERGY DEMAND DOWNWARDS</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 8 - </dateline>The Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand
outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese
energy demand, ministry officials said.
    MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy
supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600
mln, they said.
    The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in
Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen
and a decline in domestic electric power demand.
    MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand
outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the
Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.
    They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy
supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.
    Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric power
in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27
pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and
liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.

<title>TURKEY CALLS FOR DIALOGUE TO SOLVE DISPUTE</title>
<dateline>    ANKARA, April 8 - </dateline>Turkey said today its disputes with
Greece, including rights on the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea, should be solved through negotiations.
    A Foreign Ministry statement said the latest crisis between
the two NATO members stemmed from the continental shelf dispute
and an agreement on this issue would effect the security,
economy and other rights of both countries.
    ""As the issue is basicly political, a solution can only be
found by bilateral negotiations,"" the statement said. Greece has
repeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the
International Court of Justice.
    The two countries approached armed confrontation last month
after Greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the
Aegean and Turkey said it would also search for oil.
    A face-off was averted when Turkey confined its research to
territorrial waters. ""The latest crises created an historic
opportunity to solve the disputes between the two countries,""
the Foreign Ministry statement said.
    Turkey's ambassador in Athens, Nazmi Akiman, was due to
meet Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou today for the Greek
reply to a message sent last week by Turkish Prime Minister
Turgut Ozal. The contents of the message were not disclosed.

<title>IRAQI TROOPS REPORTED PUSHING BACK IRANIANS</title>
<dateline>    BAGHDAD, April 8 - </dateline>Iraq said today its troops were pushing
Iranian forces out of positions they had initially occupied
when they launched a new offensive near the southern port of
Basra early yesterday.
    A High Command communique said Iraqi troops had won a
significant victory and were continuing to advance.
    Iraq said it had foiled a three-pronged thrust some 10 km
(six miles) from Basra, but admitted the Iranians had occupied
ground held by the Mohammed al-Qassem unit, one of three
divisions attacked.
    The communique said Iranian Revolutionary Guards were under
assault from warplanes, helicopter gunships, heavy artillery
and tanks.
    ""Our forces are continuing their advance until they purge
the last foothold"" occupied by the Iranians, it said.
    (Iran said its troops had killed or wounded more than 4,000
Iraqis and were stabilising their new positions.)
    The Baghdad communique said Iraqi planes also destroyed oil
installations at Iran's southwestern Ahvaz field during a raid
today. It denied an Iranian report that an Iraqi jet was shot
down.
    Iraq also reported a naval battle at the northern tip of
the Gulf. Iraqi naval units and forces defending an offshore
terminal sank six Iranian out of 28 Iranian boats attempting to
attack an offshore terminal, the communique said.

<title>UNION TEXAS OIL RESERVES DROPPED IN 1986</title>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, April 8 - </dateline>Union Texas Petroleum said its worldwide
proved reserves fell to 511 mln barrels of oil equivalent at
the end of 1986 from 555 mln barrels reported in 1985.
    In its newly released annual report, Union Texas said it
replaced about 71 pct of its production of 56 mln barrels of
oil equivalent last year after taking into account the sale of
27 mln barrels of U.S. reserves.
    Union Texas, the nation's largest independent oil and gas
producer based on revenues, is a privately-held company owned
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co and Allied-Signal Inc &lt;ALD&gt;.
    The Houston-based company said it lost 57.5 mln dlrs on
1.26 billion dlrs in sales last year, compared to profits of
165 mln dlrs on 2.04 billion dlrs in sales in 1985.
    Union Texas said it received an average of 13.35 dlrs per
barrel for its international oil production and 2.99 dlrs per
mcf for its foreign natural gas sales. The majority of the
company's total energy production is in the United Kingdom,
Indonesia and Pakistan.
    In the United States, Union Texas said it completed
evaluation work on its oil find in Alaska's Colville Delta
area.
    ""Although significant oil reserves were confirmed,
development of this discovery will not be economical without
substantially higher prices,"" the company said.
    Union Texas said it planned to spend about 42 mln dlrs over
the next two years to develop its Eugene Island Block 371 in
the Gulf of Mexico.
    In 1987, the company said it budgeted 178 mln dlrs for
capital spending, less than half of the amount spent in 1985
and down from 199 mln dlrs budgeted last year. Union Texas also
said it would seek acquisitions of oil and gas properties as
well as petrochemical-related businesses.

<title>RECENT U.S. OIL DEMAND OFF 2.6 PCT FROM YEAR AGO</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </dateline>U.S. oil demand as measured by
products supplied fell 2.6 pct in the four weeks ended April
three to 15.73 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 16.16 mln in the
same period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration

    Gasoline demand averaged 6.76 mln bpd, off 3.1 pct from
6.98 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.15 mln
bpd, off 16.9 pct from 1.39 mln, the EIA said.
    So far this year, distillate demand fell 2.3 pct to 3.20
mln bpd from 3.28 mln in 1986, gasoline demand was 6.63 mln
bpd, off 0.3 pct from 6.65 mln, and residual fuel demand fell
4.9 pct to 1.35 mln bpd from 1.42 mln, the EIA said.

<title>U.S. OIL DEPENDENCY SEEN RISING TO RECORD LEVEL</title>
<dateline>    SAN FRANCISCO, April 9 - </dateline>The United States' dependency on
foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,
according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry
Research Associates.
    Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference
here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much
as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high
level of 47 pct in 1977.
    ""The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is
inevitable,"" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil
imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.
    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for
33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to
40 pct by 1990.
    ""However, the rate of this growth can be affected
positively or negatively through government action or
inaction,"" Lichtblau said.
    He said that one of the government's negative actions is
the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a
disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash
flow for oil exploration.
    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor
price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.
    ""An international floor price adopted by all or most
industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective
measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if
we imposed it alone,"" Lichtblau said.
    Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic
fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen
U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.
    A potential for alternative supplies could limit the
willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.
    Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer
tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans
for alternative energy.

<title>CRUDE OIL NETBACKS UP SHARPLY IN EUROPE, U.S.</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </dateline>Crude oil netback values in complex
refineries rose sharply in Europe and firmed in the U.S. last
Friday from the previous week but fell sharply in Singapore,
according to calculations by Reuters Pipeline.
    The firmer tone to refining margins in Europe and the U.S.
relected higher prices for petroleum products, particularly
gasoline, and support from crude oil prices.
    Netback values for crude oil refined in Northern Europe
rose substantially following strong gains in gasoline prices
there. Brent is valued at 19.45 dlrs, up 56 cts a barrel or
three pct from the previous week.
    In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by 14 cts to
19.33 dlrs for West Texas Intermediate, up about 0.7 pct.
    Sour grades in the U.S. Gulf showed an increase of 33 cts a
barrel for Alaska North Slope, up 1.7 pct.
    But netbacks for crude oil refined in Singapore fell
sharply, down 15 cts to as much as 68 cts a barrel as ample
distillate supplies weighed on petroleum product prices.
    Attaka in Singapore is valued at 18.55 dlrs, a decline of
68 cts a barrel or 3.5 pct from the previous week.
    For refineries in the Mediterranean, netback values were
mostly lower, with declines of seven to 14 cts. The value of
Kuwait crude fell 14 cts to 18.37 dlrs, while Iranian Light
fell 11 cts to 19.14 dlrs.
    On the U.S. West Coast, netback values for ANS CIF L.A.

<title>ECUADOR CRUDE OIL OUTPUT TO RESUME NEXT MONTH</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, April 9 - </dateline>Ecuador is due to resume limited crude oil
output on May 8 when a new 43 km pipeline to neighbouring
Colombia should be finished, an energy ministry spokesman said.
    Oil output was halted on March 5 by an earthquake which
damaged 50 km of the main pipeline linking jungle oilfields at
Lago Agrio to the Ecuadorean port of Balao on the Pacific.
    About 13 km of the new link, capable of carrying some
50,000 barrels per day (bpd), has been built, he said.
    Ecuador pumped 245,000 to 250,000 bpd before the
earthquake.
    The new link will connect Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon in
Colombia, the starting point of Columbia's pipeline to the
Pacific ocean port of Temuco.
    The government estimates it will take about four more
months to repair the Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline and return
output to normal levels, the spokesman said.

<title>SOVIET TANKERS SET TO CARRY KUWAITI OIL</title>
<dateline>    KUWAIT, April 13 - </dateline>Kuwait has agreed to charter tankers
from the Soviet Union in a move to protect its oil exports
through the Mideast Gulf, diplomatic sources said.
    They said the agreement followed months of talks with the
Soviet Union and the U.S. On ways to secure its oil exports
after Iran started to attack Kuwaiti-connected vessels in
retaliation for Kuwait's backing for Iran's war enemy Iraq.
    Diplomats said they expect three Soviet tankers initially
to reinforce other flags already supporting Kuwait's 22-tanker
fleet.
    The diplomats said they knew of no deal for Moscow to
provide a naval escort for its own vessels, but ""the idea of
protection is implicit,"" one said.
    They said Soviet cargo ships bound for Kuwait in the past
to unload arms and materiel for road delivery to Iraq were
known to have sailed under escort. So far, none of the Soviet
ships are known to have been attacked by Iran. Diplomats said
they expected the chartered Soviet tankers to sail between

<title>TEXACO &lt;TX&gt; SAYS SOME OIL FLOWS RE-ESTABLISHED</title>
<author>    By SAMUEL FROMARTZ, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </dateline>Texaco Inc has re-established some key
oil supply lines following yesterday's court filing for
protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, said
Elton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations.
    ""Several companies say they are willing to start trading,""
Yates told Reuters in an interview.
    The company last week had stated that a number of domestic
and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil
shipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.
Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.
    Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC&gt; and other banks told
Texaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco
said in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB&gt; and J.P.
Morgan Co's &lt;JPM&gt; Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits
to cover transactions, it said.
    The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose
from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme
Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL&gt; over
the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.
    The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's
plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.
    ""Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they
could,"" Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court
ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting
supplies.
    ""It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an
avalanche,"" he said. ""Supplies were cut to the point where we
could not run the system at anywhere near capacity.""
    He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in
jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages
by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton
said.
    It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,
canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,
Occidental Petroleum Co &lt;OXY&gt; demanded cash for crude, and
Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC&gt; asked for special safeguards.
    The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC &lt;BP&gt; last
week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today
said, ""a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on
supplying. They had cancelled last week.""
    He declined to identify the company.
    &lt;Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.&gt;, the Venezuelan state oil
company that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also
halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.
    But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the
Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key
supply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the
Algerians, he added.
    Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter
11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines
and oil supplies that are key to the company's business.
    ""It will be business as usual for Texaco,"" said Martin
Klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer
and Traub.
    ""Creditors are a nervous bunch of people,"" he said. ""But
when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and
will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company.""
    But other officials at Texaco were not immediately
available to say whether discussions were being held with its
banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.

<title>ABU DHABI MARKETING SAID NOT BREACHING OPEC PACT</title>
<dateline>    ABU DHABI, April 13 - </dateline>A senior Abu Dhabi oil official said
in remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), was succeeding in marketing its
crude oil without breaching OPEC accords.
    Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi
National Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company's Petroleum Community
magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations.
""The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its
customers in accordance with market conditions...And take
necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production,"" he said.
   ""The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on
adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control
production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to
stabilize the market,"" he added.
    OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln
bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.
    Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future
depended on how much discipline OPEC showed.
    Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was
ADNOC's most difficult ever but ""a practical and flexible
pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market
environment.""
    He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average
609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales
totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported.
    In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil

    ""The filing is holding up wet barrel trading today,"" said
one trader. ""Everyone is talking about it, assessing their
company's situations in relation to Texaco,"" he added.
     Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco are
concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies
under the bankruptcy filing.
    However, others were less worried. ""The first paid will be
the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the
shipping industry,"" one New York trader said.
    ""If Texaco doesn't get crude supplies it can't run its
refineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything,""
he added.
    Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement
with Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally
interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co.

toward prudence in their dealings with the company.
    Traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment or
letters of credit, or to continue to trade as usual with Texaco
on an open line basis, he said.
    Another trader, however, described today's activity as
business as usual, adding that traders feel more secure because
no liens can be put on Texaco's assets while it is in
bankruptcy.
    Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texaco
filing on crude futures trading although they said the exchange
might lower Texaco's position limit and require higher margins
for Texaco's trades.
    New York Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary McFadden
declined to comment on Texaco's futures trading, saying that is
is proprietary information. McFadden did say, however, that as
a matter of procedure, it is possible the exchange can lower
allowable position limits or increase margin requirements for
companies that are in financial trouble.

<title>ECUADOR SAYS WILL RESUME LIMITED OIL PRODUCTION</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, April 13 - </dateline>Ecuador will resume limited crude output
next week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil
to a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state Ecuadorean
Petroleum Corp (CEPE) said.
    CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador
would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in
northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in
preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to
neighbouring Colombia.
    Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an
earthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio,
at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific
port of Balao.
    It will take at least until the end of July to repair the
pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was
pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor.
    To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is
constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying
55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point
of Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco.
    The original target date to resume limited crude output was
May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago
Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman
said.

<title>ECUADOR TO USE COLOMBIA OIL LINK FOR FIVE YEARS</title>
<dateline>    BOGOTA, April 23 - </dateline>Ecuador will use a new pipeline link
with Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years,
Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said.
    The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to
allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5
by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline,
    Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its
OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts
contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador
mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said.
    The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after
signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation
of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling
will begin in September.
    ""The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only
for this emergency period but for the next five years, with
possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels
per day (bpd) will be pumped along it,"" Perry said.
    Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels
through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents
per barrel during the first year.
    The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will
run from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungle
oilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the
Pacific port of Tumaco.
    Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the
Ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures for
Colombia's 11 km segment but said it was ""insignificant compared
with what we are going to earn.""
    OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before
the quake. Lost exports of 185,000 bpd are costing it 90 mln
dlrs per month, Espinosa said.

<title>PEMEX OFFICIAL SAYS OPEC OUTPUT CRITICAL TO PRICE</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, June 1 - </dateline>Crude oil prices could remain around 18
dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision on
output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an
official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos
(Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.
    Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of
international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared
to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself
for the third quarter. ""Production is surging ahead of what was
originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than
envisaged a few months ago,"" he said.
    He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of
production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the
18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been
envisaged might soften price levels.
    The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in
Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output.
    ""I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in
terms of volume decisions,"" Lajous said.
    A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted
output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is
always there as a possibility, he said.
    ""I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I
expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and
discipline will be maintained,"" he said.
    Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as
this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil
markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during
1987 if output remains under control.
    He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that
increased production was not so important as long as incomes
would not be affected by the output, were ""very relevant and
welcome from such a powerful producer.""

<title>INDIA PLANS MORE BOMBAY OFFSHORE OIL WELLS</title>
<dateline>    BOMBAY, June 1 - </dateline>India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas
Commission (ONGC) plans to drill more wells in the Bombay
offshore area, where a well spudded in February this year gave
both oil and gas, an ONGC spokesman said.
    The exploratory well, spudded at a depth of 2,140 metres,
yielded 2,000 barrels of oil and 180,000 cubic metres of gas
per day, he said.
    ""The well, one of the four structures drilled in the area 80
km north-west of Bombay, indicates good prospects of both oil
and gas. We've decided to drill at least three more wells in
there before starting production on a commercial scale.""
    Production of Bombay High, part of the Bombay offshore
field, has stabilised at around 500,000 barrels per day for the
last two years.
    ONGC produced 27.85 mln tonnes of crude in 1986/87 ending
March, up from 27.51 the previous year. Bombay High accounted
for 20.61 mln tonnes, marginally up from 20.10 the year before.
India's total oil output is around 30 mln tonnes.
    ONGC has been exploring the Bombay offshore area, developed
since the late 1970s, for more oil as production from Bombay

<title>SAUDI RENEGOTIATION OF ARAMCO DEAL MOVING ALONG</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, JUNE 1 - </dateline>Saudi Arabia's renegotiation of its
collective agreement with Aramco to purchase oil for the
latter's ex-partners is moving along and should lead to a
fundamental structural change in the contract, oil industry
sources said.
    Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in this Monday's edition,
said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34
mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and
volumes and other terms may be rearranged.
    The agreement signed in January for the months from
February to June is up for renegotiation.
    Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mln
bpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp
&lt;XON&gt; 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc &lt;TX&gt; 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp
&lt;MOB&gt; and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV&gt; 550,000 bpd between them.
    But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarter
allowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift its
obligations under the contract
    PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is
to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective
agrement.
    John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of
a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate
schedule although separate agreements with the companies would
favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted
liftings occur .
    ""The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants within
limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long
haul,"" he said.
    Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely
concentrate on volume rather than price.
    Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted
and in April industry publications said that renegotiation were
being sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco.
    Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp &lt;CHV&gt;, Exxon
Corp &lt;XON&gt;, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB&gt; and Texaco Inc &lt;TX&gt; but is now
owned by Saudi Arabia which bought its assets although the
ex-partners have various agreements with Saudi Arabia.

OPEC OUTPUT IN MAY SEEN OVER CEILING AT 17 MLN BPD LONDON, June
1 - OPEC's May output appears to have risen well above its 15.8
mln bpd ceiling to 17 mln bpd, and the increase is likely to
put a short-term lid on spot oil prices, Kleinwort Grieveson
Securities says.
    But Kleinwort's latest World Oil Report said re-stocking
and lower non-OPEC output earlier this year should allow the
group to produce up to 17 mln bpd in the current third quarter.
    ""On the supply/demand front, the market continues to enjoy a
degree of stability rarely seen in recent years,"" it said.
    It said most OPEC members were overproducing slightly but
only the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was seriously above quota.
    The report said Saudi Arabia had been sending clear signals
on the need to maintain oil prices at current levels of around
18 dlrs a barrel and adopt provisional output rises agreed in
December when OPEC meets in Vienna on June 25. If OPEC adopts
the provisional ceilings of 16.6 mln bpd in third quarter and
18.3 mln bpd in the fourth, there will probably be room for
overproduction in the third quarter when demand for its crude
will probably be 17.5 to 18 mln, it said.
    It said that the UAE and Ecuador may demand higher quotas
in Vienna, but the biggest obstacle is Iraq, which has refused
to honour its quota as it is less than that of Gulf War enemy
Iran.
    But OPEC appears committed to a short meeting and realises
something must be done about the Iraq issue, the report said.
    According to Kleinwort's sources, Saudi Arabia has already
held separate talks with Iran and Iraq and is urging Iraq to be
more moderate.
    ""One strong indication that some kind of deal may be
eventually worked out is the almost complete silence coming
from Iran,"" it said.
    Indications are that, in return for going along with the
Saudi desire to maintain official prices in Vienna, Iran is
seeking concessions from the kingdom on the Iraq issue, it
said.
    Kleinwort said the kingdom will face an increasingly uphill
task in trying to maintain prices around 18 dlrs beyond 1987.
    Firstly, OPEC hardliners led by Iran are bound to oppose
such a move. Secondly, other OPEC members will press for
another price rise if the dollar remains weak against other
currencies.
    Thirdly, Saudi Arabia may be forced to raise prices earlier
than it intended to ward off growing calls for higher prices
from the U.S. To stimulate domestic drilling and exploration.
    The report concluded that there is a strong possibility
official OPEC prices will rise to 20 dlrs a barrel by end-1987
and 22 dlrs a barrel by end-1988.

<title>COMPROMISE SEEN LIKELY OVER CONOCO-STATOIL DISPUTE</title>
<dateline>    OSLO, June 1 - </dateline>Norway is expected to seek a compromise
solution to defuse a row between Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap
A/S &lt;STAT.OL&gt; (Statoil) and Conoco Norge A/S over which firm
will operate the Heidrun oil field, government sources said.
    The sources, who asked not to be named, said the government
will likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as the
field's operator through the development phase, with Statoil
taking over only after production starts in the early 1990s.
    Oil Minister Arne Oeien told Reuters the government had
today discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decision
had been taken and several questions remained unresolved.
    It was unlikely the government would announce its decision
on Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday's cabinet meeting
and after discussing a proposed solution with both companies,
the sources added.
    This spring Norway's state-owned oil company Statoil
exercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration license
that, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieve
Conoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised by
Conoco.

"<text>
<title>MAJOR U.S. OIL PIPELINE SHUT DOWN BY FLOODS</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </dateline>Flooding in the Red River on the
Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a
24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per
day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a
Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.
    ""The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any
divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility
that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week,"" a company
source said.
    The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and
one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.
    Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is
restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring
oil which has been lost to the flood.
    ""But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be
difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like
to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to.""
    The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield
Corp &lt;ARC&gt;, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell
Group &lt;RD&gt; and Texaco Inc &lt;TX&gt;, which is the pipeline's
operator.
     Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude
oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to
new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.
    July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to
19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.
    Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of
WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.
    Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline
shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West
Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a
barrel below WTI, respectively.
    Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days
but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River
recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is
dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area
affecting the pipeline, Stevens said.
    He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was
underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.
The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil
nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was
apparently washed away.
   
    The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed
at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this
line.
    Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not
found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,
which is nearby.

President Reagan is ready to use military force to protect
Kuwait tankers in the Gulf, the United States is ill-prepared

    Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in comments
on a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S.
participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing
program of the International Energy Agency.
    The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, was

with any future oil cutoff.
    Synar said, ""the president is prepared to take military
action to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling to
take less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare our
nation for the next energy crisis.""
    Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilers
to assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil,
increasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war. Synar,
who asked for the GAO report after criticism of U.S. action in

<title>JAPAN OIL INDUSTRY DECONTROL MAY LEAD TO MERGERS</title>
<author>    By Masaru Sato, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, June 2 - </dateline>Deregulation of Japan's oil industry could
mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into
bigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.
    They said the relaxation of controls was now under review
by the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI).
    A spokesman for a major firm said, ""Deregulation would bring
about a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freer
competition, we have no choice but to accept it.""
    The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12.
    The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it
should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It
should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of
current capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and
gasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.
    They said deregulation was vital to promote more
competition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.
    ""Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turn
to see if we can survive cut-throat competition,"" said a source
at one major Japanese oil company.
    A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, ""We'll have a hard
time surviving, but that's something we must go through.""
    ""In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for
the oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out
further into other lines such as real estate and travel
agencies,"" he said.
    Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd
which had the largest share of refined products sales in the
Japanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining
capacity in fiscal 1986.
    Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil products
in 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a
spokesman for the company said.
    Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the
Council, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies
within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the
efficiency of the industry.
    Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to
be streamlined further into five refining groups.
    ""MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to
merge into five to build up their muscles,"" a source said.
    A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out the
possibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry
in the event of the relaxation of oil controls.
    He declined to officially confirm or deny that the
Petroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures but
said that in principal MITI would encourage a move towards
deregulation.

increase that would drive consumers away and make them try and
find alternative sources (for energy).""
    OPEC agreed last December to cut production after world
prices hit new lows in 1986. They agreed on a pricing system
aimed to stabilize the market around 18 dlrs a barrel.

    OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna on June 25, where it
will review its current oil price and production policy.
    Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said last month that he wanted oil
prices to remain stable for the next two years.
    Saudi Arabia is the architect of the current pricing and
production pact, which is backed by Kuwait and the UAE. The
current pact set a production ceiling for first half 1987 of
15.8 mln bpd, and implemented fixed prices based on an 18 dlrs
a barrel average.

<title>U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY SEES HIGHER OIL PRICES</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </dateline>Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he
expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000,
probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.
    ""I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000).
Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable,"" Hodel told the

    Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through
the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells
because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was
also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.

<title>LUKMAN SEES STABLE OIL PRICE FOR NEXT COUPLE YEARS</title>
<dateline>    STOCKHOLM, June 2 - </dateline>The current crude oil price of between
18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple
of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to
keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said.
    Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade
officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint
by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government
officials said.
    They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made
the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third
World debt and industrialised nations.
    Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher
energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.
    Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the
beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial
countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead
to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he
said.
    This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high
prices, he added.
    Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a major
crisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled.

<title>MAJOR U.S. PIPELINE MAY BE CLOSED SEVERAL DAYS</title>
<author>    By BERNICE NAPACH, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </dateline>The operator of a major U.S. crude oil
pipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may be
several days before repairs are made and the system is
functioning again.
    Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
Texaco Inc &lt;TX&gt;, operator of the pipeline through its
subsidiary Texaco Pipeline Co, said the company hopes repairs
will begin in about five days and expects it to take several
more days to complete.
    ""At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to get
the job done,"" Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairs
will depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult to
assess because of flooding on the Red River.
    The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude
oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days
preceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said.
    The pipeline was shut down from Cushing, Okla, to Witchita
Falls, Kan, on Saturday due to an undetermined leak at the Red
River crossing, near the Oklahoma/Texas border, because of
severe rains, a spokesman for Texaco said.
    Stevens said it was reasonable to suggest the pipeline
could operate at full capacity when it reopens in order to make
up for the shortfull but cautioned they will talk with
customers to determine their requirements.
    Oil analysts and traders said they were not sure if the 
shutdown will continue to raise U.S. oil prices.
    Monday, after Texaco confirmed that the pipeline had been
closed, West Texas Intermediate crude in the spot market and on
New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures complex rose 20
cts a barrel.

<title>COLOMBIAN GROUP SUSPENDS BOMBINGS OF PIPELINES</title>
<dateline>    BOGOTA, June 2 - </dateline>A Colombian group announced the suspension
of its bombings of oil pipelines pending the government's levy
of a social tax on foreign petroleum companies and an 800 mln
dlrs fine on the Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY&gt;.
    There was no indication the government would meet the
conditions demanded by the leftist National Liberation Army
(ELN).
    According to the state oil firm, ECOPETROL, the ELN carried
out 72 attacks on petroleum pipelines between 1984 and 1986.
    The assaults, the most recent launched two months ago, have
caused an estimated total of 50 mln dlrs in damage.
    In a communique, the ELN said it would demand a tax of one
dollar per barrel of crude oil pumped by foreign firms as a
condition for maintaining its suspension of the assaults.
    Foreign oil firms pump an average of 225,083 barrels per
day in Colombia. Colombian tax authorities are investigating
Occidental, a U.S.-owned firm, for alleged tax evasion.
    If the charges are proven, the firm could face a fine of up
to 800 mln dlrs. The ELN demands the government charge the
penalty.

<title>EC WATCHING GULF WAR DEVELOPMENTS</title>
<dateline>    LUXEMBOURG, June 2 - </dateline>The European Community (EC) should
watch very carefully for any developments in the Gulf War and
their consequences on the oil market, EC Energy Commissioner
Nicolas Mosar said today.
    Speaking two weeks after a U.S. warship was attacked in the

tensions in the oil market.""
    ""But I do not want to be alarmist,"" he told a news conference

    He said the volume of EC oil imports from the Gulf had
declined to around 31 pct of total oil imports in the first
three months of 1987 against 35 pct in the same period last
year. ""There are also other potential sources of supplies in the
world,"" he added.
    The issue of Gulf oil imports was not discussed at the
ministers' meeting, he added.
    A EC committee of national experts in the so-called oil
supply group would discuss Gulf oil supplies at their bi-annual
meeting on June 19, he said.
    But any major decisions would have to be reserved for EC
foreign ministers, diplomats said.
    West European nations have so far shown little enthusiasm

a spokesman for an affiliated company said.

    Contractual volumes assume no production ceiling.

due to strong demand from Japan and the U.S. And tight

    A cargo of Duri loading in July was reportedly traded

Minas is trading about 20 cents higher, they said.

<title>OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS</title>
<author>    By Judith Matloff, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, June 18 - </dateline>Some OPEC states are unhappy about the
prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose
great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price
and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.
    They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference
presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances
about price differentials making some of their crudes
uncompetitive.
    There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that
OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,
to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.
    But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price
differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market
signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.
    ""All OPEC members can make a good case for changing
differentials,"" said one analyst with a major oil company. ""But
at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be ""leave well
alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.""
    Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw
sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished
customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,
marketing incentives have helped their sales.
    Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by
means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside
better priced grades in a ""package.""
    Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least
for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should
change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for
fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At
its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed
prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference
point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985
when members offered discounts to attract customers.
    OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8
mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter
and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend
or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.
    Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not
mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr
target and at most make minimal changes to differentials,
analysts say.
    The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one
non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export
crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.
Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.
    Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil
exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say
only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at
official prices, with some of the rest included in processing
or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.
    Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,
when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to
pay the new prices.
   Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude
-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --
was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.
    In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below
its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,
due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has
risen.
    Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say
its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.
    But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort
Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the
differentials question in Vienna.
    ""It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which
holds the presidency, raised the issue,"" he said.

<title>U.K. COURT RULES AGAINST RTZ ON OIL FIELD COSTS</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, June 18 - </dateline>The U.K. High Court dismissed an appeal
by Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc's &lt;RTZL.L&gt; RTZ Oil and Gas Ltd unit
and ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for the
future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible,
the Press Association reported.
    The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax
Commissioners that any such provision was a capital
expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible.
The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an
annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of
abandoning a rig.
    An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the
subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible
from corporation tax payable.
    It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all
budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he
said.
    Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability was
shared by the industry as a whole.
    The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the
expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the
expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were
built into the accounts, one analyst added.

<title>SRI LANKA PLANS TO RENEW ABU DHABI OIL CONTRACT</title>
<dateline>    COLOMBO, June 19 - </dateline>Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC) has decided
to renew its one-year contract with Abu Dhabi for 480,000
tonnes of Upper Zakum crude oil, CPC officials told Reuters.
    They said CPC made the recommendation to the cabinet and is
now awaiting its approval.
    CPC's one-year contract with Abu Dhabi expired on May 31
this year and it wants the renewed contract to begin on June 1
at the government selling price. Delivery will be determined in
the course of the year. Last year, shipments were in three
parcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each.
    CPC officials also said the company agreed with the
Egyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of Gulf of
Suez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the
government selling price.
    Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through
C.Itoh.
    Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Light
from Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several
constraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels
and proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments.
    Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where
lifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC
then proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each.
    CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for
delivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to
offload CPC's needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable.
    CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since
December. Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln
tonnes. This year it plans to buy 400,000 tonnes on the spot
market compared with about 1.3 mln tonnes last year.

<title>SAUDI OIL RESERVES RISE DESPITE HIGHER OUTPUT</title>
<dateline>    JEDDAH, June 19 - </dateline>Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi
Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according
to the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco.
    Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167
billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985,
while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft
from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said.
    Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about
200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per
day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.

    Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as
OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture
their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed
from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the
organisation decided to cut production again from last
September onwards.
    Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.
    Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly
to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the
official Saudi Press Agency.
    The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the
number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.

    Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44
mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was
upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling
it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the
report said.
    The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by
another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced
around 750,000 bpd last year.

    Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from
998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began
operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes
per day, the report said.
    Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4
billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs.

<title>OPEC PRESIDENT LUKMAN EXPECTS SHORT, CALM MEETING</title>
<dateline>    LAGOS, June 19 - </dateline>OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman
said he expects next week's ministerial meeting in Vienna to be
brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production
agreement may only need a slight review.
    ""I expect the meeting in Vienna to be short and calm,""
Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, told reporters here
ahead of his departure on Sunday for the conference, which
starts June 25.
    ""We already have an agreement which may need only a slight
review,"" Lukman said.
    The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministers
in December last year pegged the group's crude oil output at
15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18
dlrs a barrel.
    Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December to
just above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analysts
firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement
to keep the market stable.
    ""I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position to
strengthen the gains we have made so far,"" Lukman said.
    He declined to say if the current ceiling should be
maintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and
18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December.
    ""Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by our
collective will to keep the market strong,"" he said.
    He said non-OPEC member Norway, which he visited two weeks
ago, had pledged further cooperation with the group and this
was significant for its members.
    Lukman said heavy destocking by consumers early this year
when OPEC's fixed price regime came into effect and a
restocking now for the winter was responsible for current
market strength.

<title>U.S. OIL PRICES STRONG AHEAD OF OPEC MEETING</title>
<author>    By SUSAN SHERER, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </dateline>U.S. crude oil prices are at their
highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC
meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any
policy changes from the session.
    They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the
organization's accord in December, have risen on technical
factors within the market and concerns about supplies because
of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the
Gulf.
    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading
around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile
Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its
highest level since January 1986.
    OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's
oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to
be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production
agreement may only need a slight review.
    Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation
of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to
a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.
    Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon
after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased
tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices
should begin easing.
    ""OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed
to in December because oil prices are firm,"" said John Hill, a
vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.
    OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at
18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to
16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln
barrels in the fourth quarter.
    This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising
from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.
    Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,
Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a
reduction in output.
    ""And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to
trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that
OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,"" said Nauman
Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.
    But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such
as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.
    ""The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the
official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are
committed to stabilizing the market,"" said Rosario Ilacqua,
analyst with L.F. Rothschild.
    However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting
in September to re-evaluate market conditions.
    Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the
fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a
day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000
barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president
of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.
    Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this
meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to
offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated
throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,
producers receive less money for their oil.
    ""The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,""
said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.
    ""In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to
produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act
as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two
dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,"" he
said.
    One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.
    ""The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian
Gulf,"" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securites.
    Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been
regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration
is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the
U.S. flag, with naval escorts.
    ""Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis
like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that
could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,"" Knuettel said.

<title>UNOCAL&lt;UCL&gt; SCRAPS FLUIDIZED BED BOILER PROJECT</title>
<dateline>    LOS ANGELES, June 19 - </dateline>Unocal Corp said it told the U.S.
Treasury Department that it will not include fluidized bed
combustion technology, a method for the more efficient burning
of solids, at its Parachute Creek oil shale project in Colorado
due to high costs.
    Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic
Fuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology at
the oil shale plant. In return the company would have been
eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports
from the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contract
from the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.
    Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized
bed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs,
compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.
    The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and
electricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said.
    Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment
tax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project
uneconomical even with government price supports and loan
guarantees, Unocal said.
    The Parachute Creek oil shale plant produces about 4,000 to
5,000 barrels per day of crude shale oil, Unocal said.

<title>INTERNATIONAL LPG PRICES STEADY IN QUIET MARKET</title>

<title>OIL MARKETS SHOW RESPECT FOR NEW OPEC ACCORD</title>
<dateline>    SINGAPORE, June 29 - </dateline>OPEC has shown itself to be in control
of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a
pact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day
(bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said.
    They said market respect for the cartel has increased since
it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output
to 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December.
    ""There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensured
there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is in
effect putting pressure on end-users,"" a European crude oil
trader said.
    In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, ""There's no reason to expect
a weak market from now on.""
    A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, ""We
thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter
production so the market will react very bullishly.""
    Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a
slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmark
crude, they expect price increases over the next few days.
    August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at
around 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but still
below the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.
    Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and Abu
Dhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak
positions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traders
said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least.
    They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to
stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.
    They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected
and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter
requirements before October.
    Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on
European and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.
    ""There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production
by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high,"" said an
international trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was less
bullish, ""For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on
how much they (OPEC members) cheat.""
    A Singapore trade source said, ""There is enough cheating and
leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is
no need to worry about shortages.""
    Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level,
after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearish
factor to be considered.
    Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as
possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market
cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.
    Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in
thin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillates
quiet on minimal buying interest.
    Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and
tight prompt supplies, dealers said.

<title>FAR EAST TRADERS EXPECT 20 DLR OIL IN JANUARY</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, June 29 - </dateline>OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6
mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost
spot prices and enable the group to raise its official
reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current
18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.
    ""Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the
official price will be 20 dlrs in January,"" a Japanese refiner
said.
    The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC
members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and
Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.
    Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as
the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987
output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs
for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for
U.K. Brent, traders said.
    They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into
the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate
(WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.
    ""With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import
Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those
grades further,"" said a Japanese oil trader.
    Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot
market has further upward potential in the short term, having
risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.
    ""You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that
basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today,"" said
one international oil trader in Tokyo.
    ""But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought
back up again pretty quickly,"" he added.
    One oil industry analyst concurred, ""There is no reason to
expect a weak market from now on."" He said he expected OPEC to
raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.
    Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly
in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and
the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to
maintain steady prices.
    Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day
compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its
export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline
through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.
    Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,
against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up
to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.
    Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating
on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price
discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But
they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as
swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher
output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise
too high too fast.
    Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln
barrels. ""Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the
stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises
too much,"" an oil industry analyst said.

<title>SAUDI OIL COMPANY GETS NEW ACTING GOVERNOR</title>
<dateline>    RIYADH, June 29 - </dateline>The acting governor of Saudi Arabia's
state-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, has
retired at his own request, oil industry sources said.
    They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation
planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.
    Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher,
left in a major oil industry shake up last December.
    The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the
post permanently.
    The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki
Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry
sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil
market.
    The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20
years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi
Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned
to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.
    Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an
OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel
last December.
    Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations
which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia
does business, the sources said.
    The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's
job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who
earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of
Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister
Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the
University of Petroleum and Minerals, economist Ali Jonahi,

<title>NORWAY EXTENDS 7.5 PCT OIL OUTPUT CUT - MINISTRY</title>
<dateline>    OSLO, June 29 - </dateline>Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in
planned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15
until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle
told Reuters.
    ""We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,""
he said. ""The accord reached there means stability in the oil
market and we shall continue making our contribution.""
    The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would
probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle
said. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and
would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.
    OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of
16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and
retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord
based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.
    OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and
it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter
ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth
quarter.
    Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore
fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from
planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained
within its December accord on output and prices.
    Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around
840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln
bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.
    The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since
February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.
    Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for
a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement
on the latest oil production cutbacks.
    Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC
producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia
and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep
prices stable.
    Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an
OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around
18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.
    Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export
earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price
during the first half of 1986.
    But firmer oil prices since then have brought some
stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade
deficit.
     Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently
refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to
the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.

<title>EXTRACTS FROM OPEC COMMUNIQUE</title>
<dateline>    VIENNA, June 29 - </dateline>Following are extracts from the
communique issued at the conclusion of the OPEC conference
here.
    ""The conference expressed satisfaction about the positive
results of the agreement signed in December, 1986, by which
OPEC re-established the system of fixed price at a level of 18
dlrs per barrel supported by OPEC production ceilings
distributed into national production levels.
    ""The conference noted that all market indicators, including
spot prices in the market and netback values of all OPEC
crudes, have been firming up significantly, thus consolidating
the OPEC price structure as defined by the agreement.""
    ""The conference examined the supply/demand outlook for the
second half of the year and decided that in order to secure
continued firm prices in the market, OPEC production during the
fourth quarter of 1987 will be equal to that of the third
quarter, I.E. 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd), distributed into
the same national production levels as were defined by the
above-mentioned agreement for that quarter.""
    ""Furthermore, the conference decided to establish a
committee of five heads of delegation to monitor the price
evolution in the market in relation to the OPEC official prices
in order to secure price stability around the opec price
structure.
    ""Should there be any significant change in market prices,
the committee would immediately call for an extraordinary
meeting of the conference with a view to deciding on the
necessary OPEC production levels during the second half of the
year, which would secure the desired market stability.""
    ""The conference reiterated the necessity of member
countries' strict adherence to the agreement signed in December
1986, both in terms of official price, and national production,
levels.
    ""For this purpose, the conference decided to establish a
committee of three heads of delegation to undertake visits to
member countries in order to motivate them to comply with the
terms of the agreement.""

    ""Moreover, the conference stressed the necessity of the
cooperation of the oil-producing exporting countries outside
OPEC as an essential prerequisite for a lasting market
stability.
    The conference, therefore, decided to reinstate the group
of five heads of delegation established by the 77th
(extraordinary) meeting of the conference in April, 1986 to
undertake the necessary contacts with those countries.
    ""The conference observed the continued fall in the value of
the U.S. Dollar and agreed that the matter should be studied
and reported to the next meeting of the conference.""

    ""The conference discussed the appointment of the secretary
general and decided to discuss the matter again in its next
ordinary meeting.
    ""The conference extended the term of office of Fadhil
al-Chalabi as deputy secretary general for a period of one year
from October 7, 1987.
    ""The next ordinary meeting of the conference will be

<title>KUWAIT SEES OPEC OUTPUT OVER CEILING TO END-YEAR</title>
<dateline>    VIENNA, June 29 - </dateline>OPEC output for the second half of 1987,
including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln
barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday,
Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said.
    Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its
ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters
of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter
level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter
target.
    Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, ""OPEC third
quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while
fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd""
    Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production
levels would have on prices.
    Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,
rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to
adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln
barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia
and Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when
a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about
September.
    Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War
enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369
mln in the second half.
    Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from
the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has
been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. ""We will
not discuss it. There will not be any change,"" he said.
    Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended
Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems
to be adressed. ""We are overdoing it in holding too short a
meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet,"" he said.
    Ali said the problem of price differentials between the
prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly
at the meeting.

    Ali said ""The problem of differentials is a real one. I
would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem
has not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced
relative to heavy crudes.""
    Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the
next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said
""If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do
the work of another minister.""
    Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades.
    OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread
of 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes.

<title>IRAQ REJECTS NEW OPEC OIL QUOTA</title>
<dateline>    BAGHDAD, June 29 - </dateline>Iraq has rejected its new OPEC
production quota set in Vienna for the second half of this
year, the official Iraqi news agency INA reported.
    It quoted Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, who
returned Sunday, as saying ""Iraq will continue to adhere to its
position considering itself as not included in the agreement.""

    Last December, Iraq rejected its assigned first half 1987
quota of 1.466 mln bpd and demanded a share equal to the 2.255
mln bpd quota set for Iran, its enemy in the nearly
seven-year-old Gulf war.
    The accord reached by OPEC ministers in Vienna Saturday set
an output ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd for the group's 13 members
from July to December, raising Iraq's share to 1.54 mln bpd and
Iran's to 2.369 mln.

<title>CHEVRON N.SEA FIND MAY HOLD 300 MLN BBLS -ANALYSTS</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, June 29 - </dateline>A North Sea oil find announced by Chevron
Corp's &lt;CHV&gt; Chevron Exploration North Sea Ltd may indicate a
new field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mln
barrels, industry analysts said.
    Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K.
Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 API
crude oil from the tertiary ""Alba"" sand through a three-inch
surface choke.
    ""The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320
mln barrels,"" Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson
and Co told Reuters.
    He said industry estimates put the total reserves at the
field at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity of
oil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25
pct.
    Analysts said the results were encouraging, but the
potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the
field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be
plugged and a sidetrack drilled.
    ""The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will
require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs
up,"" Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said.
    Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil
found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well
showed that it flows well.
    ""Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low,
it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be
recovered,"" Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters.
    However, Chevron officials declined to comment on the
analysts' reserve estimates. They said that without further
research and drilling in the area this summer, they would not
disclose any reserve figures.
    Analysts said that if the field were declared commercial
and developed, there would be a ready local market for the
heavy crude it produced.
    ""Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and
the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a
lot narrower today,"" Osborne said.
    Chevron operates the block on behalf of 16 companies which
include British Petroleum Development Ltd, DSM Hydrocarbons
(UK) Ltd, Enterprise Oil (TNS) Ltd, Marathon Int. Pet. (GB) Ltd
and Phillips Petroleum Co U.K. Ltd.

<title>ECUADOR TO PRODUCE ABOVE OPEC QUOTA - MINISTER</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, June 29 - </dateline>Ecuador will produce crude oil in excess
of its 221,000-bpd OPEC quota during the second half of this
year, Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a news
conference.
    Ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in August, rising to
320,000 bpd next January, the minister said.
    ""We will be producing more than the quota to pay off the
crude and products we have been lent by Venezuela, Nigeria and
Kuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable to
produce during the past few months,"" he said.
    Earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut Ecuadorean
production from March to May this year.
    Santos said the move had been explained to fellow OPEC
members during last week's meeting in Vienna, when an increase
in Ecuador's quota to 221,000 bpd from 210,000 was approved.
    ""They understood our position and we believe we remain
within the spirit of the (quota) agreement,"" he said.
    Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean production
was 250,000-260,000 bpd, with 144,000 bpd exported.
    While its production was down, Venezuela, Nigeria and
Kuwait loaned Ecuador a total 12 mln barrels of crude and four
mln barrels of products, Santos said.

despite the U.S. Attack against Iranian oil platforms and
growing tension in the Gulf, Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo

    He described the situation as ""extremely tense,"" but said
Gulf military activity would not significantly affect prices
because supply and demand were roughly equal.

    Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance was
precarious and prices were in danger of falling from their
current average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction
continued.
    Three or four members of the 13-nation Organisation of

<title>WORLD COULD COPE WITH HORMUZ CLOSURE, SUBROTO SAYS</title>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - </dateline>Oil prices would skyrocket for a time if
conflict in the Gulf closed the Strait of Hormuz, but oil
supplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand,
Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said.
    He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Military
action in the Gulf.
    But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian
Petroleum Association, he said, ""If worst comes to worst and say
the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely
shut off, I believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust,
can take care of the situation.""
    ""But this is not to say that prices, at least for a short
duration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of
the situation,"" he declared.
    Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relatively
short-term impact on prices, he added.
    Assessing future price trends, he said, ""Short-term spot
prices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likely
hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per
barrel.
    ""The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greater
than the downward ones.""
    ""The balance between supply and demand in the short term
will still be delicate,"" he added. ""Non-Opec production may still
go up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increase
in world demand.""
    Subroto, a member of Opec's three-man quota committee which
has been touring cartel members, said speculation may play
havoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize the
situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers.
    In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach a
plateau in the early 1990s, leaving Opec much stronger, he
said.

<title>INDONESIA FINDS NEW OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS RESOURCES</title>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - </dateline>The Indonesian state-owned oil company

spokesman said.
    The spokesman said the discovery was made at the GOS IA-1
offshore exploratory well about 38 kms east of Langsa in Aceh.
    ""Oil and gas are found in sand layers at the depth of 2,300
metres within the Baong formation,"" he said.

<title>INDONESIA SAYS IT WILL EXTEND OIL CONTRACTS</title>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - </dateline>Indonesia told the oil industry on
Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and
improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased
expenditure on exploration in return.
    President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian
Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend
contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.
    ""In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the
government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending
production sharing contracts under the present laws,"" Suharto
said.
    ""Apart from that, the government will keep improving the
investment climate in order to accelerate the development of
the petroleum industry,"" he said.
    Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he
was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that
contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be
renewed before they would invest in further exploration.
    ""As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully
aware of this situation,"" Subroto said.
    ""The government has already made the political decision to
entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers
to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a
selective basis.""
    Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil
reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil
industry sources say.
    Subroto said the government was also working to ease other
problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or
deep water conditions.
    But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way
and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now
that the oil price had recovered.
    President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of
technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil
industry for the regions in which companies operated.
    Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company
Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production
expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to
fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in
1986.
    Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation
contracts with foreign oil companies.
    Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field
operations was a government priority. There had been
misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry
in certain areas, such as when a field is designated
commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.
    He said the government wanted to finalise contract
extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the
meantime to maintain its exploration drive.
    Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain
exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire
within 10 years. ""This need in itself is some sort of guarantee
that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.""
    Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal
between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.
    Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved
detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.
    Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions
would be selective, based on how much capital would be
invested.

<title>IRAN PLANS TO FILE LAWSUITS OVER U.S. RAID</title>
<dateline>    NICOSIA, Oct 20 - </dateline>Iran is preparing lawsuits to file for
compensation from the U.S. Over the American raid on its Gulf
oil platforms, Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.
    The lawsuits would be filed with competent international
bodies once the exact damage was calculated, he was quoted
telling a news conference in Tehran. He earlier estimated the
damage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs.
    The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American
destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after
the attack, he said.
    Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was
preliminary. Washington has said the attack was in response to
a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle
City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
    He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs
""except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence."" Reacting to
Weinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed,
Aqazadeh said: ""Iran will also consider the case closed after
its retaliatory measure."" Iranian officials have said their
response would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests
around the world might come under attack.
    Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf
aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's
oil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attack
significantly affecting oil prices.
    IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the
attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the
entrance to the Gulf.
    ""If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait, no other country can
either, and this would be to everyone's harm,"" the radio quoted

<title>NORWAY BOOSTS OIL OUTPUT BY 22 PCT IN SEPTEMBER</title>
<dateline>    OSLO, Oct 20 - </dateline>Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2
pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in
August, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here.
    Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at
several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at
fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field
rescue project.
    Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's
voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil
output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise
oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.
    Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the
production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all
its North Sea fields for the rest of the year.
    Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway
would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.
    The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which
pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,
field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.
    Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use
the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while
Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.
    BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula
field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping
to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.
    Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd
last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company
said.
    September production was also sharply higher at the
Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which
extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd
against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats
Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.
    Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like
Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd
in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous
month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.
    Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd
in September, compared with 100,188 in August.
    Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test
output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl
totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in
August.
    Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on
stream a second well, cutting September production to just two
days.

<title>SOVIET 1988 OIL OUTPUT TARGET AT 625 MLN TONNES</title>
<dateline>    MOSCOW, Oct 20 - </dateline>The Soviet oil production target for 1988
has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes over
this year's planned output.
    Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday
at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament.
    He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil
deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an
upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation
which began in late 1983.

<title>US RULED OUT ATTACK ON IRANIAN SILKWORMS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </dateline>U.S. military planners ruled out
Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack
mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the
Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.
    U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and
raided another in what the administration called a ""measured and
appropriate response"" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last
Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.
    Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig
rather than an onshore economic or military target such as
Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to
limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at
home and in the Gulf.
    ""It simply demonstrated the United States will take military
action when they (Iran) take military action,"" Norman Polmar, a
defense analyst and author, said.
    He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the
embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding
an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.
    In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the
potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that
could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.
    Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq
war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target
to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a
Security Council call for a ceasefire.
    ""We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any
chance at all,"" he said, adding that the action made it clear
tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.

   In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon
to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington
also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's
economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had
been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the
lower Gulf.
    ""We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown
Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting
capabilities,"" Cordesman said.
    He predicted the United States would respond to any future
major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar
Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the
approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.
    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the
United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, ""but
we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action
by Iran with stronger countermeasures.""

<title>SENATE BACKS U.S. RETALIATION IN GULF</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </dateline>The U.S. Senate on Tuesday backed
President Reagan's retaliatory strike against Iranian targets
in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy
in the volatile region.
    Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed
Monday's U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms in
retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship
flying the American flag.
    The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S.
resolve that Iran ""cannot take military action against the
United States with impunity.""
    Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and
set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role
in making Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not require
Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead
to a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.

<title>EX-ARCO &lt;ARC&gt; CHIEF SEES ENERGY CRISIS BY 1990</title>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, Oct 19 - </dateline>Dwindling global crude oil reserves and
the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send
the world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former Atlantic
Richfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.
    ""It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks,"" Anderson
told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. ""I
believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in
two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find.""
    Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil
and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln
barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about
4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.
    ""If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up
one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle
East,"" he said. ""We're soon going to be right back where we
were in 1973 and 1979.""
    Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at
about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.
    ""There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't
enough supply,"" he said. ""There have been no major oil
discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years.""
    Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major world
discovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of
oil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said.

<title>U.S., AT U.N., CLAIMS SELF-DEFENSE FOR GULF ATTACK</title>
<dateline>    UNITED NATIONS, Oct 19 -</dateline>The United States invoked the right
of self-defense in destroying an Iranian oil platform in the
Gulf, the American delegation told the United Nations.
    Lieutenant General Vernon Walters sent letters about the
incident to Security Council President Maurizio Bucci, the

    U.N. press secretary Francois Giuliani said the Secretary
General had no comment on the attack, which followed his appeal

platform in the Gulf on Monday and the Navy also raided a
second oil rig in retaliation for Friday's Iranian missile
attack on a U.S. flag tanker, the Pentagon said.
    President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger

<title>HUGE OIL PLATFORMS DOT GULF LIKE BEACONS</title>
<author>    By ASHRAF FOUAD</author>
<dateline>    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - </dateline>Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like
beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.
    One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,
was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.
    The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and
concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60
metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.
Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.
    The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section
of the structure remained.
    U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an
American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.
forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had
been caught laying mines.
    But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense
officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm
missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday
and the Sea Isle City on Friday.
    Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a
key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.
    Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East
now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti
tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.
    But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level
of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result
of U.S. intervention and Iran's response.
    The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a
U.S. ""tit-for-tat"" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said
Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.
    He said with this appraoch America would suffer ""the death
of one thousand cuts.""
    But for the United States to grab the initiative
militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's
harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its
shipping must pass, Schuler said.
    He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing
Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,
Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.
    Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic
initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an
arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.
    He said the United States should also threaten to mine and
blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to
acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a
settlement.
    Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by
invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the
outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style
infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.
    Each side has attacked the others' shipping.

<title>DIPLOMATS CALL U.S. ATTACK ON OIL RIG RESTRAINED</title>
<author>    By Ian MacKenzie</author>
<dateline>    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - </dateline>A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform
in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid
carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab
allies, Western diplomats in the region said.
    U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that
U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf
in response to a missile strike on the American-registered
Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
    ""We consider the matter closed,"" he said, a signal the U.S.
administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.
    Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day
against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action
would endanger American interests.
    Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War
Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a
""crushing blow.""
    ""The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in
no way get out safely,"" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.
    Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid
ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on
November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.
    Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in
Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in
preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.
    Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab
states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they
said.
    ""The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran to
respond one way or the other,"" a diplomat said.
    President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American
countermeasures if the military escalation continued.
    Western diplomats and military sources in the area said
shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act
the United States could have taken once it had decided to
retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans
and Kuwaitis on Iran.
    ""It's interesting that they chose something in international
waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation,"" one
diplomat said. ""This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf
Arab states, particularly Kuwait.""
    Commented another diplomat: ""Kuwait must be happy that the
U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked
on its doorstep.""
    One source said of the attack on the oil platform: ""They
managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the
least nuisance to everybody.""
    A diplomat commented: ""They were very clever in the place
they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated
anything because it wasn't working in the first place.""
    A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:
""This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up
... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans).""

<title>LATEST ATTACK SEEN POINTING UP DILEMMAS FOR US</title>
<author>    By CHRISTOPHER HANSON</author>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </dateline>Military experts say the United States
faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an
Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a
U.S.-flagged tanker.
    The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is
likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as
long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching
limited retaliatory strikes.
    But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps
-- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or
destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.
    ""Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the
cycle of attack and retaliation continues,"" said Fred Axelgard,
a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS).
    ""It's like a Greek tragedy,"" said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll
of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)
think tank.
    Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for
Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to
the war between Iran and Iraq.
    They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its
30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began
escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal 
would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which
President Reagan could never accept.
    U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon
news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel
fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam
oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf
time (0700 EDT) on Monday.
    Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military
base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian
Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea
Isle City on Friday.
    Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and
allowed to escape.
    ""We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will
be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran
with stronger countermeasures,"" Weinberger said.
    ""We consider this matter closed,"" he said.
    Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives
agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not
escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was
whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken
this view after earlier clashes.

of the Veslefrikk oil field, Statoil said.
    Moss Rosenberg Verft of Stavanger has been awarded a
contract to convert the the drilling platform West Vision to a
floating production platform. The work is to be completed in
the summer of 1989.
    Aker Verdal has been awarded a contract for the
engineering, purchasing and construction of the steel jacket
for the wellhead platform, also to be completed in 1989,

VENEZUELA SAYS OPEC OIL OUTPUT 0VER 18 MLN BPD CARACAS, Oct 19
- The current OPEC oil production is above 18 mln barrels per
day (bpd) and this level threatens the precarious equilibrium
of the of oil market, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister
Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.
    He told reporters three or four countries out of OPEC's 13
members were mainly responsible for the overproduction, but
declined to identify them.
     OPEC's production ceiling for the second half of 1987 is
16.6 mln bpd. The Venezuelan minister said OPEC's production
reached a peak this year when it went over 19 mln bpd in
August.
    Hernandez Grisanti, together with the oil ministers of
Nigeria and Indonesia, met the heads of state of six Mideast
Gulf countries earlier this month to urge OPEC members to
comply with assigned production quotas.
    He said some of the countries which were complying as
Venezuela, Indonesia, Libya, Algeria, Ecuador, Saudi Arabia and
Iran.
    Hernandez declined to say whether the three or four
countries he said were overproducing bordered the Mideast Gulf.

<title>AMPLE SUPPLIES LIMIT U.S. STRIKE'S OIL PRICE IMPACT</title>
<author>    By Ian Jones</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, Oct 19 - </dateline>Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on
world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains
that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the
Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.
    December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before
falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.
    ""Fundamentals are awful,"" said Philip Lambert, analyst with
stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC
production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln
bpd, little changed from September levels.
    Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC
production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and
International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September
production at 18.5 mln bpd.
    The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of
a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea
Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,
in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag
commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.
    The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the
area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.
    Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on
Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.
Attack, analysts said.
    They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which
around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in
the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.
    Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in
the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf
hostilities, analysts said.
    But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian
missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.
    Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,
said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.
    ""The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond
to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any
further action will be met with a like-for-like response.
Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,"" Pyne said.
    Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was ""a
responsible retaliation,"" with the U.S. Apparently indicating to
Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran
chose to raise the level of conflict.
    Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.
    He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as
Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests
the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a
result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian
retaliation.
    The initial upward market move this morning reflected a
strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which
was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile
launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.
    The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy
attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary
Caspar Weinburger.
    Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the
Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less
serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,
analysts and traders said.

<title>IRAN VOWS REPRISAL FOR U.S. ATTACK ON OIL RIG</title>
<dateline>    NICOSIA, Oct 19 - </dateline>Iran said several people were injured in
Monday's U.S. Attack on an Iranian offshore oil site and vowed
retaliation, Tehran radio reported.
    It quoted President Ali Khamenei as saying, ""We will
definitely retaliate and will not leave this American move
unanswered.""
    A broadcast monitored in Nicosia said several civilian
personnel on the Rashadat oil platforms in the Gulf east of
Qatar were injured when U.S. Warships bombarded them this
afternoon. It described damage as ""severe.""
    Washington said four American frigates shelled and
destroyed two Iranian platforms at the Rashadat (formerly
Rostam) field at 1100 GMT on Monday in response to Friday's
missile attack on a U.S.-flag ship in Kuwaiti waters.
    The U.S. Said Iranians used the platforms for military
pruposes and had fired on an American helicopter from the rigs
earlier this month.
    Khamenei denied that the platforms had military gear or
personnel and said the U.S. Attack lacked miltary value.
    ""With this move Mr. Reagan has committed a big mistake and
has definitely increased his problems...

<title>TASS DENOUNCES U.S. ATTACK ON IRAN AS ADVENTURISM</title>
<dateline>    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - </dateline>The official Soviet news agency Tass
denounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in
the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would
bring no dividends to the Reagan administration.
    Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration
had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect
attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms
to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels.
    ""The confrontation is a fact now. What is obvious is that
the latest military adventure will not bring political
dividends to the American administration,"" Krutikhin said.
    Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on
Monday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were
concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs.
    Soviet officials have previously criticized the United
States for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their
presence serves to increase tension.
    Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and
Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought
broader contacts with Iran in the last year.
    Krutikhin said: ""The United States has undertaken an act of
armed aggression against Iran, the probability of which has
long been spoken of by Washington officials.""

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </dateline>U.S. television networks said on
Monday that U.S. forces launched a retaliatory strike against
Iran late Sunday, apparently attacking two Iranian offshore oil
drilling platforms.
    NBC News said it understood six Iranians had been pulled
from the sea.
    It said cautiously that U.S. forces attacked late Sunday
and that two Iranian oil platforms east of Bahrain were ablaze
as a result, but CBS News and other networks said flatly that
U.S. forces attacked the Iranian oil platforms.
    U.S. officials had been meeting on a response since Friday
when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a
U.S.-flagged ship.
    President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made a
decision on the U.S. response to Friday's Iran attack but would
not say what the decision was.
    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Saturday the
attack on a U.S.-flagged ship in Kuwaiti waters on Friday was
almost certainly by an Iran Silkworm missile.

<title>SOUTH YEMEN PLANS OIL EXPORT PIPELINE - MEES</title>
<dateline>    NICOSIA, Oct 19 - </dateline>South Yemen is planning a major oil
pipeline system to be completed in 18-months time to start
exports at a initial rate of 100,000 barrels per day, (bpd) the
Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said.
    MEES said government approval for the export pipeline
followed a visit to Aden by a high ranking delegation from the
Soviet Union, which will help South Yemen construct the line
    The engineering studies for the pipeline are nearly
finished and construction is expected to start early next year,
the industry newsletter said.
    The pipeline will run about 170-200 kms (105-125 miles)
from Shabwa oilfields to a coastal terminal at Bir 'Ali on the
Gulf of Aden, MEES said.
     MEES said the Soviet firm Technoexport, which is
developing oilfileds for South Yemen, has substantially
increased its initial reserve estimates and recommended a
pipeline with an eventual 500,000 bpd capacity.
    The discovery of commercial quaotities of oil was confirmed
by Technoexport earlier this year in three structures in the
Shabwa region in the Northwestern part of the country, 200 kms
east of North Yemen's Alif oilfield.

<title>STATOIL PLACES NORTH SEA VESLEFRIKK FIELD ORDERS</title>
<dateline>    OSLO, Oct 19 - </dateline>Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil)
&lt;STAT.OL&gt;, operator on Norway's North Sea Veslefrikk oil field,
has placed field development contracts totalling 1.5 billion
crowns with two domestic yards, the company said in a
statement.
    Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier
A/S &lt;KVIO.OL&gt; won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convert
Statoil's semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating
production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed
well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said.
    Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S
&lt;AMVO.OL&gt;, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the
well-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand
in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig.
    Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a
fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field
partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several
months earlier than previously planned.
    Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln
barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km
west of Bergen.
    Statoil estimates the field's total development cost,
including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily output
is 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas.
    Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg
field pipeline at the Sture crude terminal near Bergen. Its gas
will be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas from
Norway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields.
    Partners on the field are Statoil, the operator, with a 55
pct share, &lt;Unocal Norge A/S&gt; (18 pct), &lt;Deminex (Norge) A/S&gt;
(13.5 pct), Norsk Hydro A/S &lt;NHY.OL&gt; (nine pct) and &lt;Svenska

<title>IRAN, SOVIET UNION TO SWAP CRUDE, REFINED PRODUCTS</title>
<dateline>    NICOSIA, Oct 19 - </dateline>The Soviet Union has agreed to supply
Iran with refined oil products in exchange for 100,000 barrels
per day of crude, Iran's national news agency, IRNA, said.
    IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza
Aqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that the
agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed
during his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet
Union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said.
    Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility
studies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in
southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union.
    Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of
its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf.
    Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet
Union, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he
left for Moscow.
    Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf
war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined
products.
    Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered at
the Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr, at Neka, near the
Caspian, and at Jolfa in north-west Iran.
