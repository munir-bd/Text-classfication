<title>AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN SHIP BAN ENDS BUT NSW PORTS HIT</title>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, April 8 - </dateline>Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW),
Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on
foreign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still
being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.
    The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented
the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.
    The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration
Commission today.
    Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the
ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.
    The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week
of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to
protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.
    The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to
be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of
each shift and then to walk off.
    Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with
container movements most affected, but has not stopped
altogether, they said.
    They said they could not say how long the disruption will
go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.

<title>INDEPENDENT CHAIRMAN FOR DUTCH CARGO DISPUTE</title>
<dateline>    ROTTERDAM, April 8 - </dateline>The two sides in the Rotterdam port
general cargo dispute have agreed to appoint an independent
chairman, Han Lammers, to preside over future meetings,
employers' spokesman Gerard Zeebregts said.
    Lammers, Queen's Commissioner for the province of
Flevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up an
agenda and procedures for meetings between the employers and
unions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies.
    Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 in
protest at employers' proposals for 350 redundancies from the
4,000-strong workforce this year.
    The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV on
March 13 following an Amsterdam court's interim injunction
against the redundancies on procedural grounds.
    The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 but
Zeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against the
employers and they were therefore very likely to restart the
complicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future.
    Meanwhile, the dispute over a new work-practice agreement
in the port's grain sector continued, with 30 maintenance
workers on strike, although loading was not affected, a
spokesman for Graan Elevator Mij, the largest employer in the
sector, said.
    The employers have written to the union asking it to
reconsider its position and a meeting of union members has been
called for tomorrow.

<title>AUSTRALIAN UNIONS AND NSW GOVERNMENT REACH DEAL</title>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, April 10 - </dateline>Union and New South Wales government
officials have reached a compromise in a dispute over workers
compensation, averting increased industrial action in the
state, union sources said.
    But some unions, including those of building and mining
workers, said they were dissatisfied with the deal and would
continue their strikes for a few more days.
    State officials said the government had agreed to revise
its proposals to cut compensation and would allow slightly
higher cash benefits for injured workers.
    Under the original proposal, which sparked strikes and
other industrial action in the state on April 7, workers'
compensation would have been cut by one third. Full details of
the compromise package are not yet known.
    The Labour Council, affiliated to the Australian Council of
Trade Unions (ACTU), had threatened to paralyse New South Wales
unless the government modified its pending legislation on the
issue.
    State officials said the only sectors affected in the past
three days were some government building projects, railway
freight movement and cargo handling in Sydney's ports.

<title>REAGAN HINTS U.S. WANTS HELP IN PATROLLING GULF</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 1 - </dateline>President Reagan said he would discuss
the Mideast Gulf situation with allied leaders at next week's
Venice economic summit and hinted he would seek their help in
preserving free navigation.
    In a speech prepared for delivery as the United States made
plans to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attack,
Reagan said the American people were aware that ""it is not our
interests alone that are being protected.""
    Saying that allied dependence on gulf oil was no secret,
Reagan declared, ""During the upcoming summit in Venice, we will
be discussing the common security interests shared by the
western democracies in the MIDEAST Gulf.
    ""The future belongs to the brave. Free men should not cower
before such challenges, and they should not expect to stand
alone.""
    Reagan will meet the leaders of Britain, France, West
Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan at the economic summit, which
will take place in Venice June 8-10.
   
    The 13th annual top-level meeting of the major industrial
democracies will take place against a backdrop of rising
congressional concern over Reagan's plan to protect gulf
shipping and demands that the allies do more.
     These concerns were heightened by the May 17 Iraqi missile
attack on the U.S. frigate Stark which killed 37 seamen.
    ""They died while guarding a chokepoint of freedom, deterring
aggression and reaffirming America's willingness to protect its
vital interests,"" Reagan said.
   
    In a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of
the Marshall Plan, Reagan, who spoke to an audience of foreign
affairs experts, also pledged to push for economic expansion by
West Germany and Japan to bolster the world trading system.
    ""While the vibrancy of the U.S. economy has contributed
enormously to the world expansion, preserving a growing world
economy is the business of every member of the world trading
community,"" he said.
   
    ""It will be made clear, especially to our friends in Japan
and the Federal Republic of Germany, that growth-oriented
domestic policies are needed to bolster the world trading
system on which they depend.""
    Reagan coupled this appeal with a call for compliance with
allied accords on exchange rate stability.
    ""Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at
this year's meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in
Paris and in Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten,"" he
said. ""The commitments made at these meetings need to be
translated into action.""

<title>JAPAN READY TO USE DIPLOMACY FOR GULF SECURITY</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, June 2 - </dateline>Japan was ready to use diplomacy to help
maintain the security of the Gulf, Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone said.
    But he told reporters Japan should not cut its lines of
communication with Iran and Iraq because its policy was to take
a broad political stance. Officials of the foreign ministry
said Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran and
Iraq, which have been at war since September 1980.
    Last week Nakasone ruled out Japanese military or financial
help to patrol the waters of the Gulf. About 60 pct of Japan's
crude oil passes through the waterway.
    President Reagan said yesterday the threat to oil routes in
the Gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq was high on the agenda
for next week's G-7 summit in Venice.
    Reagan has approved plans for the United States to step up
its naval presence in the Gulf despite congressional
expressions of concern and he has called on U.S. Allies to help
maintain freedom of navigation.
    Japan's constitution prevents its armed forces from being
deployed overseas. Nakasone has said that Washington
understands this problem.

<title>KUWAIT REJECTS IRANIAN SPY BOAT CHARGES</title>
<dateline>    KUWAIT, June 2 - </dateline>Kuwait, a target of Iranian anger over the
emirate's backing for Iraq in the Gulf war, today rejected
charges that fishing vessels seized recently by Iran were spy
boats.
    ""There are no bases of truth to the contents of the Iranian
accusation on the nature of the operations of the vessels
recently taken into custody by Iran. These vessels were out
fishing,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
    It said Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammad Baqeri was
summoned by the Ministry yesterday to confer with Foreign
Undersecretary Suleiman Majed al-Shaheen.
    The Iranian News Agency IRNA said on Sunday Iran had seized
seven Kuwaiti speed boats and detained their crew, who
confessed to spying for Iraq under the cover of fishing.
    It said the boats were intercepted in the Khur Abdullah
waterway which separates Kuwait and Iraq's Faw peninsula at the
head of the Gulf, captured by Iran last year.
    The Kuwaiti response came as Iranian envoys toured Gulf
Arab states saying responsibility for security and stability in
the waterway was a regional matter. A U.S. Senate team was
scheduled today to meet Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah and the defence and
oil ministers.
    Today's Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the Kuwait
News Agency KUNA, said the recent detention of Kuwaiti fishing
vessels by Iran was not the first.
    Tehran in the past had held back a number of vessels Kuwait
had sought to release through diplomatic contacts, it said.
    ""However, Kuwait is perplexed that this time the Iranian
charges are accompanied by accusations that the vessels were
undertaking espionage activities,"" it said.
    Shaheen condemned the detentions and accusations, and asked
Tehran to free all fishing boats and sailors held by Iran, the
statement said.

<title>TIGHT FAR EAST FREIGHT SPACE HITS SUGAR MARKET</title>

    This has resulted in a hardening of freight rates in those

recent fixings below 12 dlrs a tonne.

<title>OVERSEAS &lt;OSG&gt; SEES OPEC QUOTAS KEY TO RATES</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </dateline>Overseas Shipholding Group Inc president
Morton Hyman said if oil production by OPEC rises during the
second half of 1987, freight rates for tankers should rise
accordingly.
    Hyman, delivering a speech at the annual shareholders
meeting, said international tanker markets were generally weak
throughout the first quarter, but since the end of March OPEC
oil production has picked up. The result has been a modest
improvement in tanker rates.
    Overseas said 73 pct of its fleet handles liquid cargo.
   
    He said tanker requirements decreased in September 1986 as
OPEC production quotas dropped and levels of oil stocks rose.
    For the first quarter 1987, the company reported net income
of 10.3 mln dlrs, or 40 cts per share, compared to 9.3 mln
dlrs, or 36 cts per share, for the comparable quarter a year
ago.
    The company reported net income for 1986 of 37.3 mln dlrs,
or 1.45 dlrs per share.
   
    ""The improvement in the company's 1986 results, after four
years of declining earnings, reflects a sharp, albeit
temporary, rise in freight rates in the international tanker
markets last summer,"" Hyman said.
    He said the Alaskan oil trade continues to be the principal
source of employment for its U.S. flag tanker fleet, which
represents approximately 15 pct of the company's tonnage.
    Overseas owns and operates 67 vessels.

<title>U.S. TO PROTECT ONLY AMERICAN SHIPS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </dateline>U.S. military forces in the Mideast
Gulf are under orders to protect only American flag vessels and
occasional U.S. arms deliveries on other ships to
""non-belligerent"" states in the area, the Pentagon said today.
    ""No one has ever stated or supported a policy of protecting
all shipping in those waters,"" Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims said
as the Reagan Administration drew up plans to increase the
protective U.S. military presence in the gulf.
    Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutral
shipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq.
    ""As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels are
under our protection with the exception, on a limited
case-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign Military
Sales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in the
region,"" Sims said.
    U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaiti
ship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain and
Kuwait. But Sims said Washington had received assurances that
the the arms would not be used elsewhere.
    He said Kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over to
U.S. firms to fly the American flag and be protected by the
U.S. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite Iranian
charges that Kuwait is supporting Iraq in the gulf war.
    Kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated Iranian attack.
    Sims refused to say how the United States will beef up its
seven-ship Middle East Task Force in the gulf to protect the 11
Kuaiti tankers. But Pentagon officials said that additional
ships and air cover are under consideration.

<title>LAST-MINUTE OPPOSITION TO GULF BILL ARISES</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </dateline>House Speaker Jim Wright predicted
passage of legislation requiring the Reagan administration to
provide Congress with a report on its Mideast Gulf policy, but
a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals and
conservatives left the bill's fate in doubt.
    The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17th
Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,
which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision to
protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags
-- effectively making them American ships.
    Since the administration made known its reflagging plans,
congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted,
and some charged the policy could lead the United States into
the 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.
    The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the
Democratic and Republican congressional leadership and the
administration -- which demanded a report within seven days on
plans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf.
    The resolution was expected to pass without controversy
today in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the full
House was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberal
Democrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joined
in an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution.
    Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the
bill implied consent to Reagan's policies.

place any restrictions on its actions.
    The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds
of those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance
of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to
defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators
oppose President Reagan's policies in the region.
    The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17th
Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,
which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11
Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags --
effectively making them American ships.
    The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic and
Republican leadership as well as by the administration --
required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide a
report to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to
protect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf.
    It did not, however, place any restrictions on the
administration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships and
thus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy.
    The Senate was expected to approve the legislation this
week. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature.
    Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a
first step toward a greater congressional involvement in
formulating policy.
    But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask the
administration to address tough policy questions in the report.

multinational force, or failing that, an American, British,
French force with cooperation from the Gulf Arab states.

<dateline>    LONDON, June 18 - </dateline>The 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrier
Cumberlande, which sank in the South Pacific last Friday, was
carrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore,
a Lloyds Shipping Intelligence spokesman said.
    He was unable to confirm the tonnages involved.
    Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange said
the vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New South
Wales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates.
Traders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morning
trading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamental
news due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and low
stocks.
    Trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates
could convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although this
depended on the quality of the concentrates.
    A loss of this size could cause a gap in the supply
pipeline, particularly in North America, they noted. Supplies
there have been very tight this year and there is a strike at
one major producer, Cominco, and labour talks currently being
held at another, Noranda subsidiary Brunswick Mining and

<title>KUWAIT SEEN WANTING TO LEASE SOME U.S. TANKERS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </dateline>The United States said Kuwait was
discussing plans to lease privately-owned U.S. tankers to
transport oil through the Gulf in addition to putting some of
its own vessels under American flags.
    State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, who made the
disclosure about the tankers, also told reporters the United
States expects to conclude very soon a favorable arrangement
with Saudi Arabia concerning expanded security cooperation in
the Gulf. The two developments occur as the Reagan
administration continued to come under fire in Congress for its
plans to bring 11 Kuwaiti tankers under American flags.
    The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranian
attacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategic
waterway but has raised fears on Capitol Hill that it will draw
the United States into the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War.
    ""The Kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of chartering
U.S. flag vessels with the Maritime Administration,"" Oakley
said. She emphasized, however, that ""if some charter arrangement
could be worked out, it would not supplant the reflagging
arrangement that we worked out with the Kuwaitis.""
    In both cases, the ships would be eligible for U.S. Navy
escort in the Gulf, she said.

   The Washington Post today quoted John Gaughan, administrator
of the Martime Administration, as saying Kuwait has approached
an American shipping company about the possibility of a
charter.
    Gaughan said that earlier this week he told representatives
of the company, whose identify he did not know, that chartered
vessels flying the U.S. flag ""would be protected,"" the newspaper
reported.
    Concerning Saudi Arabia, Oakley said ""we are moving forward
in our talks ... on how we can tailor our efforts and security
cooperation to facilitate our Gulf operations.""

<title>CHANCES OF DIRECT U.S.-IRAN GULF CLASH SEEN LOW</title>
<author>    By Rory Channing, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    KUWAIT, June 29 - </dateline>U.S. moves to increase its warships in
and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on
unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a
direct military clash with Iran, diplomats said.
    They said the American decision inevitably carries some
risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt
rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.
    ""As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the
Gulf could do serious damage,"" said one western diplomat.
    Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks
on ""soft targets"" such as merchant shipping not protected by
American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.
    The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil
tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated
by diplomats as low. However, ""There is the threat that the
Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,
will go for softer targets,"" one diplomat said.
    Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was
""moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.""
    The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10
warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to
patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.
    The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting
Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered
to fly the American flag to give them naval protection.
    Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by
Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.
    Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by
Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is
preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.
    The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to
make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.
    A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a
launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the
Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.
    ""But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti
territory would be a very serious escalation"" likely moving
world opinion against Iran, remarked one.
    Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying
out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.
    Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted
last Friday ""a river of blood"" throughout the world in the event
of any U.S. strike against Iran.
    Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused
of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable
capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.
    Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that
most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to
pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential
trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.
    Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or
other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.

<title>U.S. REASSERTS PLANS FOR DETERRENT ROLE IN GULF</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </dateline>The United States responded to an
apparent escalation of Iranian rhetoric with continued
assurances that its expanded military force in the Gulf would
play purely a deterrent role.
    ""I can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent, that
we're going to be assuring safety for American shipping and
that that shipping is not related to the war itself,"" State
Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.
    He was asked about Iranian claims that the United States
was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran.
    Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday,
""At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink of
an armed encounter with us.
    ""We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S.
Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious. We
are determined to stand firm and will certainly win.""
    The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up its
Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending the
refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the
strategic Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf.
    The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oil
tankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flag
and gain naval protection against Iranian attacks.
    Asked about the Iranian rhetoric, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said, ""We won't have any comment or response to
the Iranian statements. Our position has been made clear about
the status of events in the Gulf. We want an end to the war
with no winners and no losers and any activities or statements
that tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are not
helpful or welcome.""
    Redman said he could not independently confirm reports that
Iran has offered to halt attacks on Gulf shipping.

    Earlier today in Washington, U.S. Television networks had

almost certainly by an Iran Silkworm missile.
    Some of the rumors in the London markets were that the
United States had launched an offshore strike against Iranian
missile installations.
