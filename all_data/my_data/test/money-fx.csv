<title>BUNDESBANK ALLOCATES 6.1 BILLION MARKS IN TENDER</title>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, April 8 - </dateline>The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1
billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities
repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank
spokesman said.
    Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,
will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy
back securities pledged on May 6.
    Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as
an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively
withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with
today's allocation.
    A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the
withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit
policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful
liquidity in the banking system.
    Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank
over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely
April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.
    The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2
billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks
themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much
liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the
effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main
open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two
further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.
    The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6
and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that
range are possible, dealers said.

<title>U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 250 MLN STG</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 8 - </dateline>The Bank of England said it forecast a
shortage of around 250 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 505 mln stg, while bills for repurchase by the market will
remove around 194 mln. In addition, a rise in note circulation
and bankers' balances below target will each drain around 110
mln stg.
    Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions
will add some 690 mln stg to the system today.

<title>BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES SOON AFTER TOKYO OPENING</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 8 - </dateline>The Bank of Japan bought a small amount of
dollars shortly after the opening at around 145.30 yen, dealers
said.
    The central bank intervened as a medium-sized trading house
sold dollars, putting pressure on the U.S. Currency, they said.
    The dollar was also supported by a major electrical
consumer goods company, which was a speculative dollar buyer at
around 145.25 yen, they added.
    The dollar opened at 145.33 yen against 145.60/70 in New

<title>POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </dateline>Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation
of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German
economic growth.
    In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs
here, Poehl said ""It would be an extremely risky policy to aim
for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to
correct the trade deficit.""
    He said the United States could face a vicious circle of
depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that
route.
    Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet
U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,
accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating
above-target money supply growth.
    He said he would have been happy to have brought forward
five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to
the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced
political constraints getting such measures through the upper
house of the West German parliament.
    But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could
accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.
    Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about
one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial
erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing
demand at home.
    ""A further appreciation of the mark could even be an
obstacle to further growth,"" he said.
    Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply
growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and
because external factors, including low oil prices and
favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.
    But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma
over monetary policy.
    The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the
reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany
was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.
    ""For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more
on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary
money supply. But we must be very careful,"" he said.
    He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's
trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as
the United States.
    Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary
officials of major industrialized countries, saying the
importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange
rates had been underestimated.
    All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the
right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he
said.
    ""This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the
part of our American colleagues,"" he said.
    But he said there was still a danger that the correction of
the dollar's value could overshoot.

<title>U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 166 MLN STG HELP</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 8 - </dateline>The Bank of England said it provided the
market with further help totalling 166 mln stg during the
afternoon.
    In band one, it bought 31 mln stg of treasury bills and
three mln stg of bank bills at 9-7/8 pct, while in band two it
bought 69 mln stg of bank bills at 9-13/16 pct. In addition, it
bought 63 mln stg of band three bank bills at 9-3/4 pct.

<title>STOLTENBERG SEES MOVES TO STRENGTHEN PARIS ACCORD</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </dateline>West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries
would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on
stabilizing foreign exchange rates.
    Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness
of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and
Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.
    But he declined to say what measures would be discussed
ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later
today.
    Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said
the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre
accord, had been underestimated.
    Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major
countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual
meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,
marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major
trading partners.
    ""There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord,"" he
said. ""We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do
not want to discuss that here.
    Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a
""slight firming"" of the yen against the dollar.
    And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged
since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell
marks to support the dollar.
    ""The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market,"" he
said.
    Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the
bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be
accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.
    Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its
pledges for economic stimulation.
    ""And we will have to see if the United States is able to do
what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit --
and get it through Congress,"" he added.
    Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further
fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against
the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis.
    ""You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And
it is not just a German problem, it is a European problem,"" he
said.

<title>J.P. MORGAN&lt;JPM&gt; SAYS DLR MAY PREVENT FED EASING</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </dateline>The relatively high level of real U.S.
interest rates suggests that there is scope for further
declines in money market rates, but the Federal Reserve is
unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains
volatile, said J.P. Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston.
    He said in response to a reporter's question after the
bank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline
further but, ""I don't think the Fed is going to encourage that
as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are.""
    On the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of the
dollar, he did not see rates going much higher.
    He said that Morgan's recent rise in its prime lending rate
was ""purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of
rates.""
    Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the U.S.
economy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth this
year.
    He also said that as a consequence of the dollar's decline
and oil price rises, inflation would rise ""moderately"" to a 3.5

<title>GERMAN MONEY MARKET SPLIT ON LOWER RATE PROSPECTS</title>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </dateline>Remarks by central bankers raised some
hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase
pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a
move in the near term, money market dealers said.
    Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday
that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from
speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central
bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower
limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.
    Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the
drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment
this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.
    The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in
new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80
pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,
as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.
    But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the
pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,
and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to
3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.
    The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on
repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.
    Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more
discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than
the more public adjustment of leading rates.
    The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and
allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case
since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may
allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.
    Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the
15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.
    Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week.
This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited
with banks.
    Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5
billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.
    Holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven
days of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above the
estimated 51 billion required for all of April.

<title>FINANCE MINISTERS AGREE ON NEED FOR STABILITY</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </dateline>Finance ministers from seven major
industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize
currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to
reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth.
    In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the
U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the
value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct
now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to
boost their economy.
    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it
a ""good meeting"" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters
other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome.
    Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign
exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened
again to prevent the yen rising too quickly.
    The communique said, ""The ministers and governors reaffirmed
the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent
Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will
be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances.""
    It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the
communique termed ""extraordinary and urgent measures"" including
an ""unprecedented front-end loading of public works
expenditures.""
    The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought
together ministers and central bank governors of the seven
major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
    The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment
on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris
when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the
then-current levels.
    In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall
against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by
the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at
around postwar lows.
    Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United
States and European countries for its only modest efforts to
open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its
exports.
    The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open
domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not
elaborate.
    It said the officials ""reaffirmed the view that around
current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.""

<title>G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </dateline>Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed
their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the
market of their resolve.
    At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa
said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a
totally new statement was needed.
    The speculative selling did not reflect economic
fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a
reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he
said.
    He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had
concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the
mark, had remained stable.
    Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the
Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental.
    ""As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression
of 'current level' is rather vague idea,"" he said.
    The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the
range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.
    It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing
a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,
Miyazawa said.
    Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the
statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven
because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other
major currencies largely have been stable.
    He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has
justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other
nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short
period since the Paris agreement.
    Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese
semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7
meeting and did not affect the currency talks.
    The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing
countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative
outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago.

<title>BUNDESBANK SEES NO CHANGE IN MONETARY COURSE</title>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </dateline>The Bundesbank sees no current reason
to change monetary course, vice-president Helmut Schlesinger
told Reuters in a telephone interview.
    Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealers
said, revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
may once again be under discussion.
    Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his
two central bank council colleagues.
    But he added that the last central bank council meeting on
April 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of
""subdued optimism,"" particularly influenced by the news brought
by several state central bank presidents.
    ""Much is going better than the impression gained by the
public from the January figures, which have been in the
meantime superseded,"" he said.
    German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a
decline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9
pct after they had been unchanged in December.
    Bank economists said that the two together showed the
economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter
of 1987.
    Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, a
steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark
rate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto
Poehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMF
meeting.
    Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates
on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase
tender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, ""Since the central
bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14
days, this is hardly probable.""
    Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved
away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of
targetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have no
comment on the subject while negotiations were still in
progress in Washington.

"<text>
<title>TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS SYSTEM NEEDS STABILITY</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </dateline>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as
had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances
from emerging in the global economy.
    In remarks before the afternoon session of the
International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he
was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.
    ""But I do suggest,"" he said, ""that we need something to give
it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction
when the wind shifts.""
    He said that indicators can serve ""as a kind of compass"" but
added that structural indicators can help focus attention on
some policies.
    Baker, however, said the IMF ""needs to move beyond
macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that
can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific
relevance to the imbalances we face today.""
    The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given
a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article
IV consultations -- that the Fund performs.
    Baker also told the policy making group that it was time
for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF
surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the
public.
    ""In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF
appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of
follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF
recommendations, and greater use of special consultation
procedures,"" he said.
    Baker emphasized that indicators were a device ""for moving
beyond rhetoric to action.""
    He said they provide ""more structure to the system, and
induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of
policy coordination.""
    He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be
reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.
    ""This should be matter of priority for the executive board,""
he said.
    Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative
medium-term economic scenarios for countries that ""can help us
focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by
identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the
implications of these options.""
    He said also that further work should be done on finding
paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.
    ""If we are to take effective remedial action when there are
significant deviations from an intended course, then we must
have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for
key variables,"" he said.

<title>U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS</title>
<author>    by Keith Leighty, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, April 9 - </dateline>Commodities from gold to grains to
cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses
in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of
inflation and economic instability.
    Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New
York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a
troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.
    A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that
inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations
to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve
Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham and Co., in New York.
    The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from
the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their
commitment to support its value, and despite reports of
intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.
    Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known
as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term
direction of the currency markets.
    ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""If
they do, it's not evident.""
    ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market
take values to where they should be.
    ""One way or another, we will force our major trading
partners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correct
the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.
    ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long
time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's
going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's
happening,"" he said.
    The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities
cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.
    At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds
saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning
to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty
McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of
Dominick and Dominick.
    The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout
the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton
posted broad gains.
    Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the
grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome
supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate
export demand.
    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department
raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by
two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.
    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately
higher.
    Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said
hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at
this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field
work to market animals.

<title>U.S. MARKETS OFFER GLIMPSE OF VOLCKER NIGHTMARE</title>
<author>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </dateline>Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financial
markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's
wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that
is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.
    For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline
as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell
sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.
    But that confidence is now cracking as the financial
markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's
often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.
    ""Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar
freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,"" said
David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.
    The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in
40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington
failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a
credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short
of further depreciation of the dollar.
    Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid
worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare
away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.
    The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12
dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike
in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down
by 33 points to 2339.
    Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the
markets' instability frightening. He believes economic
fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that ""once
you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.""
    ""There's a stark possibility that you could get a
destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates
and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.""
    Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics
in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the
controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and
264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.
    ""We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But
the agony may be fairly drawn out,"" Marris told Reuters.
    Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this
year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it
would take very little to touch off what he calls the second
phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the
dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.
    The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on
March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.
    The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with
historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are
not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its
decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.
    Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest
weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks
suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling
below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as
part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.
    Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of
confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced
plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic
imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.
    Many economists believe that long-run stability will not
return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is
addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the
massive budget deficit.
    But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of
central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no
choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.
    ""The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a
substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding
cut abroad, at least by Japan,"" said Lanston's Jones.
    Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest
rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for
American farmers, Latin American governments and others.
    But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and
Co, scoffed at the notion. ""It's ridiculous to think the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak
against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar
weakness,"" he said.
    Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being
made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.
    ""We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the
budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody
cares,"" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69
will have been greater.
    He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and
thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.
    But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that
a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. ""Put on
your helmets,"" Giordano said.

<title>CURRENCY MOVES MAY BE HURTING WORLD TRADE</title>
<author>    By Eric Hall, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 13 - </dateline>Japanese trade figures are seriously
challenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Group
of Seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates
are the key to smoothing world trade problems.
    Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo say
they are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currencies
are the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japan
shrinking?
    What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down
made world trade problems worse rather than solving them,
fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast of
world trade recession?
    U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar
fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five
pact in New York.
    The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pct
more competitive in Japan. The officials, most of them
economists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.
    Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan rising
rapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined
only 11 pct against the yen.?
    Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely
interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar
must go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct?
    At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials can
only offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.
    ""I don't know and I don't think anyone knows,"" said Hugh
Richardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.
    ""What I do know is that Community exporters are making a
hell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, there
is money to be made in Japan,"" he added.
    But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S.
Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive trade
practices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such as
agriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonable
checking and customs procedures for car imports.
    Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the
face of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, they
blame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.
    ""We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,""
said a senior official, who declined to be named. ""We like to
refrain from accusing them of not making enough effort.""
    Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of the
Keidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Morita
repeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to
understand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree. ""The real
issue is the inability of major sectors of American and
European industry to compete not only internationally but even
in their home markets,"" Peter Huggler, President of Interallianz
Bank Zurich, told a recent conference in Switzerland.

<title>U.S. TRADE DATA SEEN AS KEY TO DOLLAR TREND</title>
<author>    BY HISANOBU OHSE, REUTERS</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </dateline>The dollar's recent signs of stability
have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,
but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until
after the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.
    ""The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the
dollar has bottomed out,"" said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.
    Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value
against the yen and the mark as part of an officially
orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on
world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.
    On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen
but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,
topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.
    Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far
enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.
    The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March
from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued
improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.
    Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if
further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up
towards 150 yen.
    ""There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed
out for the medium term,"" added Tom Campbell of First National
Bank of Chicago.
    Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing
expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would
be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan's
larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and 
more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.
    The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampen
speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central
bank intervention to support the dollar.
    The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that
the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion
dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount
since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.
    Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's intervention
volume as ""impressive"".
    James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,
however: ""the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the trade
data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and
140 yen.""
    Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York
warned, ""I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet.""
    Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada
said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of
the U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.
    Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction
to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,
which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous
commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.
    President Reagan said today, ""economic policy decisions
made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of
Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be
ignored or forgotten.""
    ""The commitments made at these meetings need to be
translated into action,"" he added in a speech, celebrating the
40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.
    Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,
analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the
brunt of U.S. calls for further action.
    Marine Midland's O'Neill said, ""pressure will build up on
Germany to take stimulative action like Japan.""
    Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar
could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come
under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is
not having much impact on Japan's economy and its trade
surplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trust
banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar
positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign
portfolios, while some others have started covering those short
positions, Japanese bank dealers said.

<title>VENEZUELA TIGHTENS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS</title>
<dateline>    PANAMA CITY, June 1 - </dateline>Venezuela's central bank has ordered
Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange
operations with brokers based outside the country, according to
a copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters.
    The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has
effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's
volatile currency market.
    The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez
Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international
operations.
    The telex said the restriction on business with foreign
brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign
exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign
currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.
    In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied
rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to
prop up the weakening bolivar.
    But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de
facto currency control. ""It is definitely a control in the sense
that there's no longer complete freedom to operate,"" one broker
here said.
    ""Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction
is towards complete control,"" the broker said.
    The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his
Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since
the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with
telephone calls.
    He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume
of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs
a day. ""It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active,"" he
said.
    The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the
prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary
between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.
    ""We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's
ridiculous,"" he said. ""They've been on a rampage against
foreigners.""
    The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central
bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange
business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct
reserve requirement.
    In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in
bolivar futures, the broker said.
    ""We used to have a forward market,"" he said. ""For a small
currency it was miraculous.""
    He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.
Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range
of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running
out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free
market.

<title>POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK</title>
<author>    By Jonathan Lynn, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, June 2 - </dateline>For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is
the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has
played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for
the last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the
mark.
    President of the powerful and independent West German
central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his
contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the
end of this year, government officials say.
    (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)
    But no official announcement has yet been made, raising
eyebrows in West Germany's business community.
    The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top
ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in
opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.
    There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl
would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own
Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked
closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.
    Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul
Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international
reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.
    Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook
Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor
Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was
Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as
Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.
    In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the
dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of
the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution
which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent
inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts
of galloping inflation this century.
    But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and
inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe
to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the
dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.
    ""I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the
dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the
Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark
would endanger the economy in West Germany,"" he told business
journalists in Frankfurt recently.
    Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that
Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.
    ""Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not
focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external
economy,"" she said.
    An economist at a German bank, who declined to be
identified, said ""If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will
certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so
rigidly oriented towards money supply.""
    One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to
persuade the United States to stop ""talking down"" the dollar. For
Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that
the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise
currencies.
    The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency
dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in
fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.
    ""This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they
don't know - what the central banks can do,"" Poehl says of
intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates
round, making a speculator's position worthless.
    Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist
in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.
    A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over
a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.
    He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and
play golf.
    Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute
for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.
    ""But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount
if you strike at the right moment,"" he said. Bundesbank dealers
are very professional and skilled. ""They've burnt the fingers of
many people,"" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,
the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.

<title>TAIWAN CURBS INFLOWS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE</title>
<dateline>    TAIPEI, June 2 - </dateline>Taiwan's central bank announced that as
from today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of local
and foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached at
the end of May.
    The central bank's statement added that the measure would
be effective until the end of July.
    Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of
foreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. They
added that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge
of the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend
foreign exchange to importers and exporters.
    Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks
reached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,
according to official statistics.
    Last week the central bank said that from today it would
reduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40
pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move
was needed because of ""distortions"" in the foreign exchange
market.
    Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar,
have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank
market to avoid exchange rate losses.
    Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May
reached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9
billion in April.
    All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted
into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming
exports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in
the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.
    In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on
remittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to
Taiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money.
    Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of
the local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of
speculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has
flowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S..
    Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about
22 pct against the U.S. Dollar.
    Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the
foreign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on
capital outflows. The central bank has said the controls will
be dropped by the end of July or early August.
    Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement caused
jitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavy
purchases of U.S. Dollars. They said the central bank sold
about 30 mln U.S. Dlrs.
    Taiwan's stock market plunged a record 75.53 points to
close at 1,803.08.

<title>KUWAITI DINAR RATES FIRM, AID WINDOW OPEN</title>
<dateline>    KUWAIT, June 2 - </dateline>Interest rates on Kuwaiti dinar deposits
held firm in scattered trading despite a Central Bank decision
to revive limited funding lines, dealers said.
    The Central Bank, which last Tuesday shut a daily aid
window through which it lent funds of up to one year, reopened
the facility for three month money, which was available at
seven pct, they said.
    It offered one month funds at seven pct through swap
facilities, dealers said.
    Today's Central Bank action, combined with sales of dollars
by some banks, helped ease a recent credit squeeze engineered
by the monetary authority to stem a rush for the U.S. Currency
arising from attractive U.S. Interest rates and Gulf tension,
dealers said.
    However, as one dealer noted: ""The market is still
unsettled.""
    Overnight funds, bid at 20 pct at the outset of business,
traded up to 30 pct before easing as liquidity dragged offers
down to 10 pct by the close. Tomorrow-next, for which buy/sell
quotes started at 30, 20 pct, ended at 14, eight.
    Spot-next was indicated at 8-1/2, seven after opening bids
of 10. Dealers quoted one-week at eight, seven against an early
9-1/2, 7-1/2.
    One month rates were at the same level after trade at eight
then 8-1/2. Dealers quoted three months at seven, 6-3/4 pct and
six-month to one year funds at seven, six pct. They reported
offshore offers of overnight at 10, tomorrow-next at eight and
one year at 6-1/2 pct towards the close.
     The Central Bank fixed its dinar exchange rate steady at
0.27933/67 to the dollar, against yesterday's 0.27939/73. The
spot dinar was 0.27930/40.

<title>LAWSON SAYS LOUVRE CURRENCY ACCORD SATISFACTORY</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, June 2 - </dateline>The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven
finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies
has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the
economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
    Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce
any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work
remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting
world economic growth.üside measures to boost growth, he said.

    ""I think it is possible that there may be scope for a
further reduction in interest rates in Germany,"" he added, but
stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was
likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.
    Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on ""a gradual reduction
of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.""
    He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced
""satisfactory exchange rate stability,"" in part thanks to heavy
coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and
he was ""content"" with sterling's exchange rate.
    Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May
currency reserves announced today he said, ""we have been playing
a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a
very much greater extent than we had done hitherto.""
    Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may
falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic
commitments underlying the accord.
    ""Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange
rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their
commitments in Paris ... In this respect."" He said the U.S.
Budget deficit was ""very important.""
    Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson
said, ""what is really needed in Japan is an increase in
merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.""
    ""There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural
goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is
wholly unjustified,"" he said.
    Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in ""Japan
bashing"" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation
package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase
Japanese development aid over the next three years.
    Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange
membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.
    He said he thought West Germany would instead come under
pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to
jack up faltering economic growth.
    In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring
forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts
scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with
the privatisation of German national industries.
    On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan
to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to
make progress in Venice.
    The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign
debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World
Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.
    Lawson said he would seek ""to consolidate political backing
for the plan at the Venice summit"" and hoped the programme would
be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.
    He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase
Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt
provisions.
    ""First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market
response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this
sort of move than they felt before Citicorp,"" he said.
    U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,
strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.
""They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,""
Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to
determine the appropriate size of provisions.
    He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be
discussed at the summit. ""There is a consensus, which we have to
push further.""

<title>LAWSON CALLS INTERVENTION PROOF OF STABILITY GOAL</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, June 2 - </dateline>The scale of foreign exchange intervention
the Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof of
Britain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed
between the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris in
February, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
    Saying he was ""content"" with sterling's current value, Lawson
told reporters he wanted ""to maintain the exchange rate
stability we have all signed up for."" He declined to say if he
favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels.
 May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion
stg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention.
    In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg.
    Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, ""We have been
playing a very full part ourselves"" in meeting our commitments
toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris.
    ""We wish to see it (stability) continuing,"" he added.
    Asked which techniques were available to preserve
stability, Lawson said both central bank intervention and
interest rate changes could be used to tackle ""the market
pressures there are from time to time.""
    ""Interest rate stability is not an objective in that
sense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times,"" he added.
    Lawson said he expected intervention to be ""sterilised"" by
draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new
issues of government securities and foreign currency sales,
when the market allowed.
    This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention,
he said.
    ""Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not
necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs,"" Lawson
said. ""I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale.""

<title>LEUTWILER WANTS FIRMER MARK AGAINST SFR</title>
<dateline>    BADEN, Switzerland, June 2 - </dateline>Fritz Leutwiler, chairman of
BBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie and a former Swiss National Bank
president, urged the National Bank to declare its intent of
achieving a rising rate for the mark against the Swiss franc.
    In a speech to shareholders, Leutwiler said, ""A gradually
rising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would be
desirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and with
regard to sustaining Swiss industry.""
    ""Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank of
issue (Swiss National Bank) could have a positive effect,"" he
said.
    Leutwiler, who served 10 years as head of the Swiss central
bank, said such a step would not contradict the National Bank's
target of monetary stability.
    ""Bringing the franc close to the mark would, of course, have
to be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetary
policy,"" he told shareholders. ""Realistically there is in fact no
persuasive reason why the German currency is quoted almost 20
pct lower than the Swiss.""
    A National Bank spokesman said the relation of the mark and
Swiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over a
long period of time.
    The spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market,
not the central bank, and it would be impossible to influence
individual parities separately.
    Leutwiler said the Swiss National Bank could not support
the value of the dollar, even in conjunction with other central
banks, without putting monetary stability in jeopardy.
    ""I would be the last to recommend that. The key to a
stronger dollar lies in the United States itself,"" Leutwiler
said.

<title>VOLCKER DEPARTURE REVIVES DLR, INFLATION FEARS</title>
<author>    by Jeremy Solomons, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    New York, June 2 - </dateline>Paul Volcker's decision not to go for a
third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of
Alan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about
the U.S.' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem
rising inflation, financial market analysts said.
    Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation
fighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing in
the U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enough
political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough
campaign against inflation over the next year or two.
    ""The critical issue is how (Greenspan) will deal with
inflation,"" said Stephen Axilrod, Vice Chairman of Nikko
Securities Co International Inc and former staff director for
monetary and financial policy at the Fed.
    ""A lot of questions have been raised by Volcker's
departure. Until Greenspan answers them, the markets will
remain nervous,"" added Stephen Slifer, money market economist
at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.
    This morning's announcement sent the dollar into a
tailspin, which was halted only by concerted central bank

<title>NEAR TERM STRENGTH SEEN FOR CURRENCY FUTURES</title>
<author>    by Patricia Campbell, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, June 2 - </dateline>Currency futures are likely to move
higher following the sharp rally today after President Reagan
announced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term as
Federal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominated
as his replacement, currency analysts said.
    Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,
analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between
now and the June 8 Venice economic summit.
    In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude to
the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,
analysts said.
    Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing
a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in
Chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a
technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,
analysts said.
   
    ""Disappointment of European central bankers over the
appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar
lower,"" said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol
Mackoff.
    ""The international community will not like this
appointment,"" as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.
budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and
that Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to
reduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David
Horner.
     Furthermore, ""that Greenspan was not named two months ago
suggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --
and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,""
Horner said.
    A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures
prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigated
only by concrete action as opposed to ""jawboning"" at the G-7
summit, he said.
    But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may
be at an impasse, analysts said.
    Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neither
planned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the
U.S. to do so, Mackoff said.
    The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit
as Japan and West Germany have urged, she said.
    Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut its
budget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the
dollar could be forestalled, Horner said.
    However, ""the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing
changes,"" Horner said.
    Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane

<title>NEW ZEALAND BUDGET FORECAST SEEN AS POSITIVE</title>
<dateline>    WELLINGTON, June 18 - </dateline>Analysts said they were surprised at
the government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for
fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy
statements and positive for the economy.
    Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus
for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs
against a 1.95 billion deficit last year.
    Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus
was even more positive than the most bullish analysts'
forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.
    Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters
before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a
2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.
    The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and
the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically,
the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite
lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more
confident about investing in New Zealand, he said.
    However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying
the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will
move lower.
    The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after
hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget
release.
    Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share
market, despite an increase in the contribution of company
taxation to revenue figures.
    One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus
announcement could push the share market up by 50 points
tomorrow.
    The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a
continuation of existing policies, and the absence of
traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively
by overseas investors, another said.
    But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax
avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share
market, particularly multi-national companies.
    The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,
through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The
requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln
N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.
    Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and
there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another
economist said. He added that the document seemed entirely
credible.
    ""Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects,""
he said.
    An election is due before the end of September.

<title>TAIWAN DOLLAR AND RESERVES SEEN RISING MORE SLOWLY</title>
<author>    By Chen Chien-Kuo, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TAIPEI, June 19 - </dateline>Recent government moves to curb capital
inflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan's
foreign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollar
against the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said.
    Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the
reserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past two
weeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against the
U.S. Dollar.
    Chang said, ""The pace of increase in our reserves is much
slower now than before and our currency is getting more stable.""
He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surplus
with the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S.
Dlrs a month between January and May.
    The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and
West Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs.
    On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings of
local and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bank
purchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90
pct of the value of a contract.
    Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures had
drastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange to
importers and exporters.
    They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollar
transactions showed a drastic decline with some banks
registering a fall of up to 30 pct.
    Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised against
the U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanese
cents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of five
to eight cents in May.
    The bank dealers said the central bank, which had
previously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1
billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercial
demand.
    They said they expected the government to keep the local
dollar stable in the near term to give breathing space to
businesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise of
more than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar since
September 1985.
    The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today,
unchanged from yesterday.
    Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said,
""It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflow
is quite successful.""
    Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slower
rise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure from
Washington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan.
    Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayed
imports of machinery and production equipment because of
exchange rate uncertainty, he said. The stable exchange rate
would help boost imports, particularly from the United States.

<title>JAPAN PANEL URGES WORLD ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENTS</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, June 19 - </dateline>Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the
value of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. And
other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, an
advisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency
(EPA) said.
    The advisory body said in its report that the yen would
soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global
basis were delayed.
    An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall to
slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed to
restructure their economies.
    The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut
Japan's current account surplus to two pct of gross national
product (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a change
would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually
during the seven-year period to 1993.
    If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar
would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan's
current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. This
scenario put Japan's GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.
    It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy
and four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.

    A low index figure indicates a high value for the crown.

<title>VENEZUELA LOWERS EXCHANGE RATE FOR OIL EARNINGS</title>
<dateline>    CARACAS, June 29 - </dateline>Venezuela's cabinet approved a new
exchange rate for oil and mining export earnings, setting it at
14.50 bolivars to the dollar from 7.50 bolivars previously,
Minister Manuel Azpur UA said.
    Azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
measure is ""fundamental to conserving the economic and financial
strength of the petroleum industry.""
     He said the new exchange rate, which goes before the
central bank for final approval tommorrow, will allow the state
oil company Petroleos De Venezuela, S.A.(PDVSA) to solve its
problem of working capital and implement investment plans,
estimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987. He did not say when
the measure would become effective.
   Venezuela's oil industry previously sold its dollar earnings
to the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreign
exchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars.
   The new exchange rate will promote purchases of domestic
goods and services by the industry, Azpur said. He added that
it would also put PDVSA in a position to purchase more
government debt bonds.                        
    PDVSA had available liquid assets of 20 billion bolivars at
the start of this year, of which nine billion were in a trust
fund in the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) and placed in
government bonds.
  According to a contract between PDVSA and the central bank,
the BCV must provide cash as the oil industry requries by
repurchasing the bonds.
    PDVSA's contribution to the treasury last year was 44.480

<title>IF DOLLAR FOLLOWS WALL STREET JAPANESE WILL DIVEST</title>
<author>    By Yoshiko Mori</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </dateline>If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street,
Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a
serious way, Japan investment managers say.
    The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollar
securities, have already sold U.S. Equities.
    But ""if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happen
yesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw
significant funds from U.S. Shares,"" said Akira Kawakami, deputy
manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's
international investment department.
    An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japanese
investment in U.S. Bonds. ""Japan-U.S. Interest rate
differentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothing
in the absence of dollar stability,"" said Kawakami.
    U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture
following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S.
Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effect
should be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise.
    But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiating
to see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar was
holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning.
    ""Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in
New York yesterday, most are still looking for chances to
lighten their U.S. Stock inventories,"" Hiromitsu Sunada, manager
of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment
department said.
    Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points
to 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914.
    ""Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult,
considering the dangers,"" said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy general
manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed
income securities marketing group.
    Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once
markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managers
said. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one
or two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for.
The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield for
the 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said.
    ""The basic background which has supported the stocks and
bonds markets has not changed,"" said Norio Okutsu, assistant
general manager of Nikko Securities' bond department. ""But new
outflows of funds to the U.S. Will be decreasing.""  However,
this was already evident three months ago, he said.

<title>LOUVRE REAFFIRMATION NOT ENOUGH - U.K. ANALYSTS</title>
<author>    By Rowena Whelan</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </dateline>U.S. And West German reaffirmation of
support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental
problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the
current collapse in stock markets, London economists said.
    ""There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the
dollar is going to be allowed to slip,"" said Richard Jeffrey of
Hoare Govett. ""If not, there is going to be continued fear that
when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to
tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the
U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.""
    But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which
dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the
very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation
fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.
    ""If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street
...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,"" said
Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from
other London and Tokyo analysts.
    Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of
further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary
pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.
    Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the
equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.
    ""It would be suicidal for any government in the context of
what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their
interest rates,"" he added.
    Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime
lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed
chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial
system.
    The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock
collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking
crisis for example, thus precipitating recession.
    It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of
1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said
today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and
that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in
mind.
    ""The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.
If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic
growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a
more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,"" said Capel's
Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in
danger.
    ""The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is

    David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world
market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven
(G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,
as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies
is still on.
    Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by
expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money
supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency
stability.
    But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said
Morrison. ""The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To
stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong,"" he said.

<title>BAKER SEEN WINNING GERMAN INTEREST RATES BATTLE</title>
<author>    By Felix Dearden</author>
<dateline>    BONN, Oct 20 - </dateline>The United States appears to have won a
transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest
rates, European economists said.
    But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing
the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were
plunging.
    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to
currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,
according to official statements released late Monday.
    Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the
Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks
liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct
facility rate offered last week.
    While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank
president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added
money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a
strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.
     ""It's round one to the Americans, "" said Richard Reid,
senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in
London.
    But Reid added, ""We shouldn't forget that it has taken one
of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West
Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05
percentage point.""
    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening
of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and
fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.
    Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's
Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary
policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -
the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
    The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets
and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading
in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was
quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.
    Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche
Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world
stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West
German short-term interest rates on Tuesday.
    ""The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market
losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits
with Baker's wishes, then all the better,"" he said.
    No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the
Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises
in the U.S., Aschoff said.
    Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central
bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he
thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.
    Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston
Ltd in London said ""The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat
and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the
security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was
before the IMF meeting last month in Washington.""
    Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was
reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity
at 3.60 pct, Keating noted.
    Economists said the United States now appeared to have
agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support
the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.
    Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder
Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg
told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule
out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening
on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.
    Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West
Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency
stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central
banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them
to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.

<title>TREASURY'S BAKER UNDER FIRE FOR WALL STREET DROP</title>
<author>    By Alver Carlson</author>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </dateline>As official Washington sought to
restore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street
collapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from
critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.
    Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for
boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an
international accord to stabilize currency values.
    Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was
among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped
spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors
think that a clash between the two major economic powers would
damage the world economy.
    Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, ""I
think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I
think, was partly due to statements that have been made by
senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic."" It was a
dispute that should never have happened, he added.
    Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a
hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  
still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United
States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to
Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.
    Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, ""His
timing could not have been worse.""
    One government bond salesman in New York said, ""He actually
thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack
the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much
understanding of international monetary gamesmanship.""
    However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march
toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.
    ""On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if
you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial
markets), it was West German policy,"" said Robert Brusca of
Nikko Securities International in New York.
    ""All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so
making him responsible for it was a little like killing the
messenger,"" he said.
    After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments
made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together
in Paris in February, was still in effect.
    Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be
a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to
the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash
wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.
   Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about
Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the
global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest
rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.
    He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th
month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic
expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge
market for debtor country exports.
    Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried
that the Republican party might face next year's presidential
election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly
tarnished.
    A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt
crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has
already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.
    ""There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the
economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around
quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and
eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,""
former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a
television interview.
    In many ways, the official response was mild.
    Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,
with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting
that he was ""puzzled.""
    U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately
returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments
and, presumably, their political impact.
    For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in
Washington will diminish because of the market fall.
    Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because
of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd
Bentsen said with some irony, ""Oh, I think it's much too late to
be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the
attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---
retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't do
that.""

<title>BAKER/STOLTENBERG MEETING SOOTHES MARKETS</title>
<author>    By Jonathan Lynn and Anthony Williams</author>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - </dateline>News of a meeting between U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing the
dollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.
    News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great
secrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by
Baker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fears
that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.
    The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two
pfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.
    The announcement of the meeting, also attended by
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneously
in Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York
markets.
    Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies
accepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry
spokesman in Bonn said.
    The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of
1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.
    The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market
reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest
rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that
West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.
    Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to
coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with
the surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating
their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget
deficit.
    West German government sources said rising West German
money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre
pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest
rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising
since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed
raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.
    German yields have also risen over this period, but less
markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up
short-term rates by changing the terms on its security
repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the
money market.
    The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,
compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's
inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,
but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the
Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary
growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,
bank economists said.
    This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the
pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the
more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.
    In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,
the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this
morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.
anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.
    ""They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much
under American fire,"" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at
Swiss Bank Corp here.
    ""It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a
significant retreat from its position,"" added Giles Keating,
economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.
    The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of
the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact
on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market
economists said.
    Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank
does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation
rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,
little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.
    The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication
that the meeting would take place, although the Finance
Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.
    Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to
comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre
accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he
assumed monetary cooperation would continue.
    The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West
Germany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit
Denmark and Belgium.

<title>TRANSATLANTIC ROW IMPERILS LOUVRE ACCORD-DEALERS</title>
<author>    By Guy Collins</author>
<dateline>    PARIS, Oct 19 - </dateline>The Louvre accord on currency stability,
which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since
last February, appeared in serious danger today as a
transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to
the boil, foreign exchange dealers said.
    But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and
bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial
countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem
between the United States and West Germany and insisted that
the currency pact was still alive.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market
fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term
interest rates. ""That's not in keeping with the spirit of what
we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,""
Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was
referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group
of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the
pact.
    Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both
have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic
growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.
Agreed to stop talking the dollar down.
    However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre
agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate
move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.
    ""The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that
he's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets
are off in terms of currency cooperation,"" Chris Johns, currency
analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.
    But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine
view, telling Reuters that ""the exchange market is apparently
reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker
comment will regret it later on.""
    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the
Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to
respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for ""a faithful
and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the
Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit.""
    Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British
Treasury commented on the row.
    But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite
U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, ""this does
not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the
Louvre Accord.""
    In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive
of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that
following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.
Was still committed to the accord.
    In a move which the market interpreted as a possible
gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term
liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on
Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected
medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also
stepped into the French money market to hold down rates,
injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose
close to eight pct.

<title>GERMAN FINANCIAL POLICY MAKERS IN RARE DISSENSION</title>
<author>    By Jonathan Lynn</author>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - </dateline>Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's
central bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are
normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the
central bank's independence.
    But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,
president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a
controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of
the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.
    Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last
Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and
interest rates
    Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's
criticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place
for foreign investors.
    ""The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and
Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign
investors,"" said one economist for a London broker, who asked
not to be identified.
    Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial
policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to
steer the economy through a particularly difficult time.
    ""There are plenty of objective pressures which will result
in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill
feeling,"" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.
    News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct
withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in
a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and
abroad.
    Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the
finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the
Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting
details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.
    Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under
extraordinary pressures lately.
    Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his
deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight
inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had
pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.
    In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like
Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been
warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply
growth would eventually lead to rising prices.
    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank
council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his
views, bankers said.
    ""Poehl is in a minority in his own house,"" said Commerzbank's
Pfister.
    ""Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not
entirely his own,"" said another economist.
    The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,
they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark
and hurting West German exporters.
    The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the
Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.
    Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James
Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.
    Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986
war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.
Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to
stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.
    One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round
of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.
    But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for
Stoltenberg than he had bargained for.
    The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted
most popular government politician last year, had to face
resistance from local barons in the government coalition
parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.
    The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising
4.3 billion marks.
    But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will
push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the
government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.
    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row
which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.
    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last
month early to sort out a row in the northern state of
Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.
    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after
allegations of a ""dirty tricks"" election campaign led to heavy
losses for the CDU in state elections.
    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last
weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.
    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more
remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and
was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this
year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government
gave Poehl another eight-year term.
    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he
hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.
    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was
not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the
Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.

of interest rates. He favoured raising the rates, which are
currently well below the annual inflation rate of 33.2 pct.
    But the sources said he ran into opposition from Finance

<title>BALLADUR INSISTS ON MAINTENANCE OF LOUVRE ACCORDS</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, Oct 19 - </dateline>French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
issued a firm call for the continued faithful application of
the Louvre accords on currency stability by all major
industrial countries.
    Balladur, responding to weekend remarks by U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker that the U.S. Would take another look at

for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged

    The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance
Ministers in Washington last month.
    But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate
rise was ""not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to.""

simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their

regardless of a sharp rise in the gold price.
    Inflation is running at an annual rate of some 17 pct and
the rand is around 49.53 U.S. Cents. Most economists estimate
continued high inflation.
    Volkskas predicted the rand will remain fairly steady for

<title>BANKS EXTEND TRADING HALT IN LEBANESE POUND</title>

extended its suspension of trading in the Lebanese pound for
two more working days to study ways to stem the currency's

    The Central Bank did not post the rate of the pound to the

Wednesday's close of 384.00/386.00.
    Association sources told Reuters Friday's suspension of

more days so as to study proposals to reinforce the pound.
    The Association, which comprises 106 commercial banks in
east and west Beirut, halted trading on Friday in a chaotic

    The pound, hit by the inability of Lebanon's religiously

<title>LOUVRE ACCORD STILL IN EFFECT, JAPAN OFFICIAL SAYS</title>
<author>    By Kunio Inoue</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - </dateline>The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations
still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize
currencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.
    And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the
weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower
range for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank of
Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.
    ""The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and
anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it
later on,"" the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.
    The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the
dollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he
noted.
    A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in
monetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would
never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar
against the mark or the yen.
    The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between
140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.
    The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and
141.35 yen.
    ""Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higher
interest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this
does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework
of the Louvre accord,"" the Finance Ministry official said.
    He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any
further rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only
hurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt
problem.
    Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their
interest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets
further, the monetary officials said.
    Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined
to be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further
decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary
expectations in the U.S.
    ""That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre
agreement is still operative,"" the senior ministry official
said.
    Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that
Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West
Germany's increase in short-term interest rates.
    The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.
Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar
decline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,
try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the
accord, foreign exchange dealers said.
    But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional
statement that ""the Louvre agreement is still operative,"" and
this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the
dealers said.
    Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in
Tokyo currency markets.
    The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised
pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates
higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,
or international economic policy coordination.
    The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other's
economic policies and from time to time apply ""peer pressure"" to
persuade others to change their policies to a desired course,
they noted. ""Without such a basic agreement of multilateral
surveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German
policy so openly,"" the ministry official said.
    The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy
should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy
coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse
of the Louvre agreement, the official said.
    He also said Japan has not received any specific request
from the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term
money rates have been edging higher.
    ""This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking
policy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate
rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons,"" he
added.

<title>ECONOMIST URGES MORE TAXES TO LOWER N.Z. DOLLAR</title>
<dateline>    WELLINGTON, Oct 19 - </dateline>An income tax surcharge and capital
gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of
the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.
    Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the
Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to
restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by
current government policies.
    The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn
would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.
He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could
be much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.
    Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a
percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was
probably unavoidable, Bayliss said.
    He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct
value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,
but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.
Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary
impact of a currency depreciation.
    The government had failed to bring inflation down despite
lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.
    New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to
end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.
    The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation
policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and
insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss
said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt
and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.
    ""The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are
going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought
is soundly based -- primarily because the government's
macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,"" Bayliss said.

<title>TOKYO DEALERS SEE DOLLAR POISED TO BREACH 140 YEN</title>
<author>    By Rie Sagawa</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - </dateline>Tokyo's foreign exchange market is watching
nervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below the
significant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.
    ""The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is
considered to be the lower end of the reference range. If the
currency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,""
said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.
    The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Friday
closes of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.
    The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of
140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New York
and 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.
    The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.
    ""The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish
sentiment after Baker's comments,"" said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. He
said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among
the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the
Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.
    The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day
drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness
in U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.
    Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he
strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest
rates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience
with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord
due to their fears of increasing inflation.
    Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary
pressures also slow domestic demand.
    West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to
boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade
deficit, Tanaka said.
    U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still
massive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest
rates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.
    ""Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations
coordinate dollar buying intervention,"" said Soichi Hirabayashi,
deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange
department.
    The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally
considered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.
    ""The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near
future and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nations
failing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvre
accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,""
Hirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as low
as 135 yen soon.
